  description: The study of war and training of your body has been your life for
    as long as you care to remember. You trained as a youth, studied the use of
    weapons and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay
    alive on the battlefield. You might have been a part of a standing national
    army, or a mercenary company, or perhaps a member of a local militia who
    rose to prominence during a recent war. You likely haven't seen extensive
    service yet, but you find yourself ready.
