  description: You grew up in the wilds, far from civilization and the comforts of
    technology. You've witnessed the migration of herds of larger than forests,
    survived weather more extreme than any city-dweller could comprehend, and
    enjoyed the solitude of being the only thinking creature for miles in any
    direction. The wilds are in your blood. whether you were a nomad, an
    explorer, a recluse, a hunter-gatherer, or even a marauder. Even in places
    you don't know the specific features of the terrain, you know the ways of
    the wild.
