  name: Entertainer (Gladiator)
  description: A gladiator is as much an entertainer as any minstrel or circus
    performer, trained to make the arts of combat into a spectacle the crowd can
    enjoy. This kind of flashy combat is your entertainer routine, though you
    might also have some skills as a tumbler or actor. Using your by popular
    demand feature you can find a place to perform in any place that features
    combat for entertainment-perhaps a gladiatorial arena or secret pit fighting
    club.
