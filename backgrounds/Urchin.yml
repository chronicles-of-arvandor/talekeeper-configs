  description: You grew up on the streets alone, orphaned, and poor. You had no
    one to watch over you or to provide for you, so you learned to provide for
    yourself. You fought fiercely over food and kept a constant watch out for
    other desperate souls who might steal from you. You slept on rooftops and in
    alleyways, exposed to the elements, and endured sickness without the
    advantage of medicine or a place to recuperate. You've survived despite all
    odds, and did so through cunning, strength, speed, or some combination of
    each, and maybe even a few lucky breaks.
