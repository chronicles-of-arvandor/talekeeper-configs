  name: Guild Merchant
  description: You belong to a guild of traders, caravan masters, or shopkeepers.
    You likely don't craft all your items yourself, but earn a living by buying
    and selling the works of others (or raw materials artisans need to practice
    their craft).Your guild might be a large merchant consortium (or family)
    with interests across the region. Perhaps instead you choose to transport
    those goods from one place to another yourself, by land or sea, bringing
    them to retailers instead of selling the bulk of them yourself.
