  name: Dwarven Traditional Crafter
  description: The Stout Folk are well known for their artisanship and the worth
    of their handiworks, and you have been trained in that ancient tradition.
    For years you labored under a dwarf master of the craft, enduring long hours
    and dismissive, sour-tempered treatment in order to gain the fine skills you
    possess today.
