  description: As a child, you were perhaps inquisitive when your playmates were
    raucous. In your formative years, you found your way to one of Faerun's
    great institutes of learning, where you were apprenticed and taught that
    knowledge is more valuable than gold or gems. For whatever reason, now you
    are ready to leave your home-not abandon it, but to quest for new lore to
    add to its storehouse of knowledge or establish a new repository.
