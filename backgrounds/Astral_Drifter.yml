  description: "For an amount of time you could not possibly know, you have
    travelled the Astral Sea. There, you experienced firsthand the wonders of
    the Silver Void: you stopped aging for who knows how long, and no longer
    felt hunger or thirst. Driven by wanderlust but without control or
    direction, you drifted from one part of the astral sea to another, like a
    mote of dust on the wind. You have lost count of decades that have passed
    since you arrived, but now, you have returned, changed. in your travels,
    you  might have camped on the petrified hulks of dead gods and narrowly
    escaped the psychic winds that sweep across the Astral Sea while also
    avoiding prolongued contact with the plane's most dangerous  denizens."
