  name: Noble Knight
  description: A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies,
    but it can be a path to higher status, and they will typically be served by
    a small group of retainers to reinforce and support their position. They
    serve to reinforce the rule of their betters, in hopes of one day rising
    through the ranks. Atleast one of your retainers is likely to be a noble who
    serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own
    path to knighthood, as you continue to reinforce the ways of the system.
    Other retainers are likely to provide services such as a groom to care for
    your horse and a servant who polishes your armor.
