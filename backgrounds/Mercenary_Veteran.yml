  description: As a sell-sword who has fought battles for coin, you're well
    acquainted with risking life and limb for a chance at a share of treasure.
    Now, you look forward to fighting greater foes and reaping even greater
    rewards in this new land. Your experience makes you familiar with the ins
    and outs of mercenary life, and you likely have harrowing stories of events
    on the battlefield, weather or not they're your own, or even true, is
    another matter.
