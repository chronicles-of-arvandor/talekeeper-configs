  description: "You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific\
    \ god or pantheon of gods. You act as an \nintermediary between the realm of the\
    \ holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering \nsacrifices\
    \ in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You are not\
    \ necessarily a clericâ€” \nperforming sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling\
    \ divine power."
