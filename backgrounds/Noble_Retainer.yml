  description: you understand weath, power, and privlege. You carry a minor noble
    title, and your family owns some modest piece of land, collects taxes, and
    wields political influence. You have been sent out to follow in the foosteps
    of a knight, so that you might join similar ranks and bring honour to your
    family name. The state of your family's title is likely in decline, but
    you're going to see that those fortunes change.
