  name: Noble
  description: You understand wealth, power, and priviledge. You are in line for a
    noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields some
    level of political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat unfamilar
    with work or discomfort, a former merchant just elevated tn nobility, or a
    disinherited scoundrel with a disproprotionate sense of entitlement. Or you
    could be an honest landowner who cares about the people who live and work on
    your land, keenly aware of your responsibility to them.
