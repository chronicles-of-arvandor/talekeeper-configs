  description: A select few from policing forces are picked out from the rank and
    file, and are made investigators, those who are responsible for solving
    crimes after the fact. Though such folk are seldom found in rural areas,
    nearly every settlement of decent size has atleast one or two watch members
    who have the skill to investigate a crime scene and track down criminals.
    those who relentlessly seek the truth however, don't always find themselves
    welcome in established order, and some folks may not stay official
    investigators, instead taking on cases for individual interests.
