  description: "Many factions pursue their agendas without regard for political
    boundaries, and their members operate anywhere the organization deems
    necessary. These groups can include listeners, rumormongers, smugglers,
    sellswords,  cache-holders and haven keepers, to name a few. At the core of
    every faction are those who don't merely fulfill a small function for that
    organization, but who serve as its hands,  head, and heart. You were
    recruited or joined one of these factions at some point in your life and
    found companionship amongst the like minded. "
