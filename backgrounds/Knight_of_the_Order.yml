  name: Knight of the Order
  description: You belong to an order of philosopher knights who have sworn oaths
    to achieve certain goals. You are likely a fledgling knight, but you have
    promised yourself and your service to the order. The nature of your goals
    depends on the order you serve, but in your eyes it is a vital and honorable
    endeavor worthy of your very life. Though the term "knight" may conjure
    ideas of mounted, heavily armored warriors of noble blood, most knightly
    orders are more focused on a set of goals and philosophies, which are
    typically more important than the gear and fighting style of its members and
    so members of an order may be any sort of folk willing to support, battle
    for and even die for the order's cause, be it warrior, poet, blacksmith, or
    noble.
