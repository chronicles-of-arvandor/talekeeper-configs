      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Performance} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - While performing, you can try to distract one humanoid you can see who
          can see and hear you. Make a Charisma ({@skill Performance}) check
          contested by the humanoid's Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. If your
          check succeeds, you grab the humanoid's attention enough that it makes
          Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) and Intelligence ({@skill Investigation})
          checks with disadvantage until you stop performing.
