      items:
        - Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your
          Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice
          within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your
          proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically
          succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a
          target becomes {@condition frightened} of you for 1 minute. If the
          {@condition frightened} target takes any damage, it can repeat the
          saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
