        the following benefits:"
    - ==: FeatListEntry
      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Deception} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - When you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn, you can
          replace one attack with an attempt to deceive one humanoid you can see
          within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma
          ({@skill Deception}) check contested by the target's Wisdom ({@skill
          Insight}) check. If your check succeeds, your movement doesn't provoke
          opportunity attacks from the target and your attack rolls against it
          have advantage; both benefits last until the end of your next turn or
          until you use this ability on a different target. If your check fails,
          the target can't be deceived by you in this way for 1 hour.
