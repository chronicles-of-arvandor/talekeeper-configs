      items:
        - You gain proficiency in one {@table skills|phb|skill} of your choice.
        - Choose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise
          with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
          ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that
          isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that
          doubles your proficiency bonus.
