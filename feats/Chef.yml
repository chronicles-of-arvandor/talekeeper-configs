      items:
        - You gain proficiency with {@item cook's utensils|phb} if you don't
          already have it.
        - As part of a short rest, you can cook special food, provided you have
          ingredients and {@item cook's utensils|phb} on hand. You can prepare
          enough of this food for a number of creatures equal to 4 + your
          proficiency bonus. At the end of the short rest, any creature who eats
          the food and spends one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points regains
          an extra {@dice 1d8} hit points.
        - With one hour of work or when you finish a long rest, you can cook a
          number of treats equal to your proficiency bonus. These special treats
          last 8 hours after being made. A creature can use a bonus action to
          eat one of those treats to gain temporary hit points equal to your
          proficiency bonus.
