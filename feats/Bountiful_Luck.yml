      value: Your people have extraordinary luck, which you have learned to mystically
        lend to your companions when you see them falter. You're not sure how
        you do it; you just wish it, and it happens. Surely a sign of fortune's
        favor!
    - ==: FeatStringEntry
      value: When an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the {@dice
        d20} for an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can
        use your reaction to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the
        new roll.
    - ==: FeatStringEntry
      value: When you use this ability, you can't use your Lucky racial trait before
        the end of your next turn.
