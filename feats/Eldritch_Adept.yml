      value: Studying occult lore, you learn one {@filter Eldritch
        Invocation|optionalfeatures|Feature Type=EI} option of your choice from
        the warlock class. Your spellcasting ability for the invocation is
        Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat). If
        the invocation has a prerequisite of any kind, you can choose that
        invocation only if you're a warlock who meets the prerequisite.
