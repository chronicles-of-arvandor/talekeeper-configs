      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Animal Handling} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - You can use a bonus action on your turn to command one friendly beast
          within 60 feet of you that can hear you and that isn't currently
          following the command of someone else. You decide now what action the
          beast will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you
          issue a general command that lasts for 1 minute, such as to guard a
          particular area.
