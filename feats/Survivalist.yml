      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Survival} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - You learn the {@spell alarm} spell. You can cast it once without
          expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you
          finish a long rest.
