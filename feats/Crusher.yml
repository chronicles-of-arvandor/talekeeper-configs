      items:
        - Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals
          bludgeoning damage, you can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space,
          provided the target is no more than one size larger than you.
        - When you score a critical hit that deals bludgeoning damage to a
          creature, attack rolls against that creature are made with advantage
          until the start of your next turn.
