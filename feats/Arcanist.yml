      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill. If you are already
          proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to
          checks you make with it.
        - You learn the {@spell prestidigitation} and {@spell detect magic}
          spells. You can cast {@spell detect magic} once without expending a
          spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long
          rest.
