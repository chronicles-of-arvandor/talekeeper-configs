      value: "{@note This feat is presented as an illustrative example of a
        poorly-designed feat, and is not intended to be used in play. The {@feat
        Fell Handed|UAFeats} feat is presented as a well-designed implementation
        of the same ideas, and should be used instead.}"

      value: When you hit a creature with a {@item warhammer|phb}, the  creature must
        succeed on a Strength saving  throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus +
        your  Strength modifier) or be knocked {@condition prone}.
    - ==: FeatStringEntry
      value: In addition, you can use your warhammer to  knock away a foe's shield. If
        you hit a creature  that's using a shield, you can have the attack
        deal  no damage and force the creature to drop its  shield.
