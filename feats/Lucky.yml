      value: You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right
        moment.
    - ==: FeatStringEntry
      value: You have 3 luck points. Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability
        check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an
        additional {@dice d20}. You can choose to spend one of your luck points
        after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined. You choose
        which of the {@dice d20}s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or
        saving throw.
    - ==: FeatStringEntry
      value: You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against
        you. Roll a {@dice d20}, and then choose whether the attack uses the
        attacker's roll or yours. If more than one creature spends a luck point
        to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no
        additional dice are rolled.
    - ==: FeatStringEntry
      value: You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.
