      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Religion} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - You learn the {@spell thaumaturgy} and {@spell detect evil and good}
          spells. You can cast {@spell detect evil and good} once without
          expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you
          finish a long rest.
