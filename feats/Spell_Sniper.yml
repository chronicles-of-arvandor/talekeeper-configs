      items:
        - When you cast a spell that requires you to make an attack roll, the
          spell's range is doubled.
        - Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
        - "You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the
          cantrip from the {@filter bard|spells|level=0|class=bard|spell
          attack=m;r;o}, {@filter cleric|spells|level=0|class=cleric|spell
          attack=m;r;o}, {@filter druid|spells|level=0|class=druid|spell
          attack=m;r;o}, {@filter sorcerer|spells|level=0|class=sorcerer|spell
          attack=m;r;o}, {@filter warlock|spells|level=0|class=warlock|spell
          attack=m;r;o}, or {@filter wizard|spells|level=0|class=wizard|spell
          attack=m;r;o} spell list. Your spellcasting ability for this cantrip
          depends on the spell list you chose from: Charisma for bard, sorcerer,
          or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard."
