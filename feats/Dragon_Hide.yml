      value: "You manifest scales and claws reminiscent of your draconic ancestors.
        You gain the following benefits:"
    - ==: FeatListEntry
      items:
        - Your scales harden. While you aren't wearing armor, you can calculate
          your AC as 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use a shield and
          still gain this benefit.
        - You grow retractable claws from the tips of your fingers. Extending or
          retracting the claws requires no action. The claws are natural
          weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with
          them, you deal slashing damage equal to {@dice 1d4} + your Strength
          modifier, instead of the normal bludgeoning damage for an unarmed
          strike.
