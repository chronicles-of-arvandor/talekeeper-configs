      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Intimidation} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - When you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn, you can
          replace one attack with an attempt to demoralize one humanoid you can
          see within 30 feet of you that can see and hear you. Make a Charisma
          ({@skill Intimidation}) check contested by the target's Wisdom
          ({@skill Insight}) check. If your check succeeds, the target is
          {@condition frightened} until the end of your next turn. If your check
          fails, the target can't be {@condition frightened} by you in this way
          for 1 hour.
