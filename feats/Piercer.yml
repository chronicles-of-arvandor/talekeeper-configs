      items:
        - Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals
          piercing damage, you can reroll one of the attack's damage dice, and
          you must use the new roll.
        - When you score a critical hit that deals piercing damage to a
          creature, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the
          extra piercing damage the target takes.
