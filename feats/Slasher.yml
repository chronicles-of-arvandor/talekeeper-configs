      items:
        - Once per turn when you hit a creature with an attack that deals
          slashing damage, you can reduce the speed of the target by 10 feet
          until the start of your next turn.
        - When you score a critical hit that deals slashing damage to a
          creature, you grievously wound it. Until the start of your next turn,
          the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls.
