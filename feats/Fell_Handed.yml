      items:
        - You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with the weapon.
        - Whenever you have advantage on a melee attack roll you make with the
          weapon and hit, you can knock the target {@condition prone} if the
          lower of the two {@dice d20} rolls would also hit the target.
        - Whenever you have disadvantage on a melee attack roll you make with
          the weapon, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength
          modifier (minimum of 0) if the attack misses but the higher of the two
          {@dice d20} rolls would have hit.
        - If you use the {@action Help} action to aid an ally's melee attack
          while you're wielding the weapon, you knock the target's shield aside
          momentarily. In addition to the ally gaining advantage on the attack
          roll, the ally gains a +2 bonus to the roll if the target is using a
          shield.
