      items:
        - When you hit with an attack using a {@filter simple or martial
          weapon|items|source=phb|category=basic|type=martial weapon;simple
          weapon}, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice an additional
          time and add it as extra damage of the weapon's damage type. Once you
          use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a short or
          long rest.
        - Immediately after you use your Relentless Endurance trait, you can use
          your reaction to make one weapon attack.
