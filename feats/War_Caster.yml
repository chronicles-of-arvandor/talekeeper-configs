      items:
        - You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to
          maintain your {@status concentration} on a spell when you take damage.
        - You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have
          weapons or a {@item shield|phb} in one or both hands.
        - When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from
          you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather
          than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time
          of 1 action and must target only that creature.
