    - ==: FeatListEntry
      items:
        - You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a flail.
        - As a bonus action on your turn, you can prepare yourself to extend
          your flail to sweep over targets' {@item shield|phb|shields}. Until
          the end of this turn, your attack rolls with a flail gain a +2 bonus
          against any target using a {@item shield|phb}.
        - When you hit with an opportunity attack using a flail, the target must
          succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus +
          your Strength modifier) or be knocked {@condition prone}.
