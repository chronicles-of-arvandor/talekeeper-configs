      items:
        - You learn the {@spell mage hand} cantrip. You can cast it without
          verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand
          {@condition invisible}. If you already know this spell, its range
          increases by 30 feet when you cast it. Its spellcasting ability is the
          ability increased by this feat.
        - As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature
          you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must
          succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus +
          the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved
          5 feet toward you or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this
          save.
