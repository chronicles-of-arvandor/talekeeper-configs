      items:
        - When you make a damage roll that deals poison damage, it ignores
          resistance to poison damage.
        - You can apply poison to a weapon or piece of ammunition as a bonus
          action, instead of an action.
        - You gain proficiency with the {@item poisoner's kit|phb} if you don't
          already have it. With one hour of work using a {@item poisoner's
          kit|phb} and expending 50 gp worth of materials, you can create a
          number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once
          applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains its
          potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition.
          When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition,
          that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or
          take {@damage 2d8} poison damage and become {@condition poisoned}
          until the end of your next turn.
