      items:
        - You learn two {@filter Metamagic|optionalfeatures|Feature Type=MM}
          options of your choice from the sorcerer class. You can use only one
          Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless the option says
          otherwise. Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score
          Improvement feature, you can replace one of these Metamagic options
          with another one from the sorcerer class.
        - You gain 2 sorcery points to spend on Metamagic (these points are
          added to any sorcery points you have from another source but can be
          used only on Metamagic). You regain all spent sorcery points when you
          finish a long rest.
