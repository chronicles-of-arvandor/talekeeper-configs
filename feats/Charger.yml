      value: When you use your action to {@action Dash}, you can use a bonus action to
        make one melee weapon attack or to {@action shove} a creature.
    - ==: FeatStringEntry
      value: If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before taking
        this bonus action, you either gain a +5 bonus to the attack's damage
        roll (if you chose to make a melee attack and hit) or push the target up
        to 10 feet away from you (if you chose to shove and you succeed).
