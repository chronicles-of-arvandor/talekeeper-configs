      items:
        - On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or
          reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee
          weapon attack as a bonus action.
        - Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon that you are
          proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack
          roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.
