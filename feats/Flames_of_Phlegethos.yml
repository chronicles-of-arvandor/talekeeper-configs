      items:
        - When you roll fire damage for a spell you cast, you can reroll any
          roll of 1 on the fire damage dice, but you must use the new roll, even
          if it is another 1.
        - Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire damage, you can cause flames
          to wreathe you until the end of your next turn. The flames don't harm
          you or your possessions, and they shed bright light out to 30 feet and
          dim light for an additional 30 feet. While the flames are present, any
          creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with a melee attack takes
          {@damage 1d4} fire damage.
