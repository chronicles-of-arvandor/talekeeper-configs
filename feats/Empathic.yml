      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Insight} skill. If you are already
          proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to
          checks you make with it.
        - You can use your action to try to get uncanny insight about one
          humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a Wisdom ({@skill
          Insight}) check contested by the target's Charisma ({@skill
          Deception}) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on
          attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of
          your next turn.
