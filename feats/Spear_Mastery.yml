      value: "Though the {@item spear|phb} is a simple weapon to learn, it rewards you
        for the time you have taken to master it. You gain the following
        benefits:"
    - ==: FeatListEntry
      items:
        - You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a spear.
        - When you use a spear, its damage die changes from a {@dice d6} to a
          {@dice d8}, and from a {@dice d8} to a {@dice d10} when wielded with
          two hands. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already
          improved the weapon's die.)
        - You can set your spear to receive a charge. As a bonus action, choose
          a creature you can see that is at least 20 feet away from you. If that
          creature moves within your spear's reach on its next turn, you can
          make a melee attack against it with your spear as a reaction. If the
          attack hits, the target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} piercing damage,
          or an extra {@damage 1d10} piercing damage if you wield the spear with
          two hands. You can't use this ability if the creature used the
          {@action Disengage} action before moving.
        - As a bonus action on your turn, you can increase your reach with a
          spear by 5 feet for the rest of your turn.
