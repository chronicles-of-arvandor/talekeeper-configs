      items:
        - You learn one cantrip of your choice from the {@filter artificer spell
          list|spells|level=0;1|class=artificer}, and you learn one 1st-level
          spell of your choice from {@filter that
          list|spells|level=0;1|class=artificer}. Intelligence is your
          spellcasting ability for these spells.
        - You can cast this feat's 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you
          must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You
          can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.
        - You gain proficiency with one type of {@filter artisan's
          tools|items|type=artisan's tools} of your choice, and you can use that
          type of tool as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses
          Intelligence as its spellcasting ability.
