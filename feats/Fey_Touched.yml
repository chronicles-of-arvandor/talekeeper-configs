      items:
        - You learn the {@spell misty step} spell and one {@filter 1st-level
          spell|spells|level=1|school=E;D} of your choice. The {@filter
          1st-level spell|spells|level=1|school=E;D} must be from the divination
          or enchantment school of magic. You can cast each of these spells
          without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells
          in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you
          finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots
          you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is
          the ability increased by this feat.
