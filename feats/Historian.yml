      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill History} skill. If you are already
          proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to
          checks you make with it.
        - When you take the {@action Help} action to aid another creature's
          ability check, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill History})
          check. On a success, that creature's check gains a bonus equal to your
          proficiency bonus, as you share pertinent advice and historical
          examples. To receive this bonus, the creature must be able to
          understand what you're saying.
