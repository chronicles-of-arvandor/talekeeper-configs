      value: "Your study of high elven lore has unlocked fey power that few other
        elves possess, except your eladrin cousins. Drawing on your fey
        ancestry, you can momentarily stride through the Feywild to shorten your
        path from one place to another. You gain the following benefits:"

      items:
        - You learn to speak, read, and write {@language Sylvan}.
        - You learn the {@spell misty step} spell and can cast it once without
          expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way
          when you finish a short or long rest. Intelligence is your
          spellcasting ability for this spell.
