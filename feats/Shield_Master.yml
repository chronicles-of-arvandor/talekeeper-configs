      items:
        - If you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn, you can use a
          bonus action to try to {@action shove} a creature within 5 feet of you
          with your shield.
        - If you aren't {@condition incapacitated}, you can add your shield's AC
          bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other
          harmful effect that targets only you.
        - If you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity
          saving throw to take only half damage, you can use your reaction to
          take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, interposing your
          shield between yourself and the source of the effect.
