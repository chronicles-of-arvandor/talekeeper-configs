      items:
        - Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically
          become {@condition invisible} until the end of your next turn or until
          you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once
          you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a short
          or long rest.
