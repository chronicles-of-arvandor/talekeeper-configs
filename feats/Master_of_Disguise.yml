      items:
        - You gain proficiency with the {@item disguise kit|phb}. If you are
          already proficient with it, you add double your proficiency bonus to
          checks you make with it.
        - If you spend 1 hour observing a creature, you can then spend 8 hours
          crafting a disguise you can quickly don to mimic that creature. Making
          the disguise requires a {@item disguise kit|PHB}. You must make checks
          as normal to disguise yourself, but you can assume the disguise as an
          action.
