      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Acrobatics} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - As a bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill
          Acrobatics}) check. If you succeed, {@quickref difficult terrain||3}
          doesn't cost you extra movement until the end of the current turn.
