      value: You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the {@spell
        detect magic} spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell
        slot. You also learn {@spell levitate} and {@spell dispel magic}, each
        of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain
        the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long
        rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
