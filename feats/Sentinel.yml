      items:
        - When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's
          speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
        - Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the
          {@action Disengage} action before leaving your reach.
        - When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target
          other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use
          your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking
          creature.
