      value: You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and
        protected by your people. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice.
        You also learn the {@spell longstrider} and {@spell pass without trace}
        spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot.
        You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you
        finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three
        spells.
