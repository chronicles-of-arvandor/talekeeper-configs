      items:
        - When you take the {@action Attack} action and attack with only a
          {@item glaive|phb}, {@item halberd|phb}, {@item quarterstaff|phb}, or
          {@item spear|phb}, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack
          with the opposite end of the weapon; this attack uses the same ability
          modifier as the primary attack. The weapon's damage die for this
          attack is a {@dice d4}, and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.
        - While you are wielding a {@item glaive|phb}, {@item halberd|phb},
          {@item pike|phb}, {@item quarterstaff|phb}, or {@item spear|phb},
          other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they enter
          the reach you have with that weapon.
