      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Nature} skill. If you are already
          proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to
          checks you make with it.
        - You learn the {@spell druidcraft} and {@spell detect poison and
          disease} spells. You can cast {@spell detect poison and disease} once
          without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so
          when you finish a long rest.
