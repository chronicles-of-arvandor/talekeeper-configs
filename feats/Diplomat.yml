      items:
        - You gain proficiency in the {@skill Persuasion} skill. If you are
          already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus
          to checks you make with it.
        - If you spend 1 minute talking to someone who can understand what you
          say, you can make a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check contested by
          the creature's Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. If you or your
          companions are fighting the creature, your check automatically fails.
          If your check succeeds, the target is {@condition charmed} by you as
          long as it remains within 60 feet of you and for 1 minute thereafter.
