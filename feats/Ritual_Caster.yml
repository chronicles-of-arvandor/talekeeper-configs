      value: You have learned a number of spells that you can cast as rituals. These
        spells are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while
        casting one of them.

      value: "When you choose this feat, you acquire a ritual book holding two
        1st-level spells of your choice. Choose one of the following classes:
        {@filter bard|spells|level=1|class=bard|components &
        miscellaneous=ritual}, {@filter
        cleric|spells|level=1|class=cleric|components & miscellaneous=ritual},
        {@filter druid|spells|level=1|class=druid|components &
        miscellaneous=ritual}, {@filter
        sorcerer|spells|level=1|class=sorcerer|components &
        miscellaneous=ritual}, {@filter
        warlock|spells|level=1|class=warlock|components & miscellaneous=ritual},
        or {@filter wizard|spells|level=1|class=wizard|components &
        miscellaneous=ritual}. You must choose your spells from that class's
        spell list, and the spells you choose must have the ritual tag. The
        class you choose also determines your spellcasting ability for these
        spells: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or
        druid; or Intelligence for wizard."

      value: If you come across a spell in written form, such as a magical {@item
        spell scroll} or a wizard's spellbook, you might be able to add it to
        your ritual book. The spell must be on the spell list for the class you
        chose, the spell's level can be no higher than half your level (rounded
        up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell
        into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50
        gp per level. The cost represents material components you expend as you
        experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you
        need to record it.
