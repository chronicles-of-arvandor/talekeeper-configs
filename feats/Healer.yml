      items:
        - When you use a {@item healer's kit|phb} to stabilize a dying creature,
          that creature also regains 1 hit point.
        - As an action, you can spend one use of a {@item healer's kit|phb} to
          tend to a creature and restore {@dice 1d6 + 4} hit points to it, plus
          additional hit points equal to the creature's maximum number of Hit
          Dice. The creature can't regain hit points from this feat again until
          it finishes a short or long rest.
