        maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:"
    - ==: FeatListEntry
      items:
        - You learn two {@filter maneuvers|optionalfeatures|feature type=MV:B}
          of your choice from among those available to the {@class
          fighter|phb|Battle Master|Battle Master|phb|2-0} archetype in the
          fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a
          saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC
          equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity
          modifier (your choice).
        - You gain one superiority die, which is a {@dice d6} (this die is added
          to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is
          used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you
          use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a
          short or long rest.
