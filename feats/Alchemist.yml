        practice, gaining the following benefits:"
    - ==: FeatListEntry
      items:
        - You gain proficiency with {@item alchemist's supplies|phb}. If you are
          already proficient with them, you add double your proficiency bonus to
          checks you make with them.
        - As an action, you can identify one potion within 5 feet of you, as if
          you had tasted it. You must see the liquid for this benefit to work.
        - Over the course of any short rest, you can temporarily improve the
          potency of one {@item potion of healing} of any rarity. To use this
          benefit, you must have {@item alchemist's supplies|phb} with you, and
          the potion must be within reach. If the potion is drunk no more than 1
          hour after the short rest ends, the creature drinking the potion can
          forgo the potion's die roll and regains the maximum number of hit
          points that the potion can restore.
