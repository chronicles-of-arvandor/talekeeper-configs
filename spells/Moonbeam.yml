    value: A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high
      cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light
      fills the cylinder.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or
      starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing
      pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes {@damage
      2d10} radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it
      also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different
      form until it leaves the spell's light.

    value: On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to
      move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.
