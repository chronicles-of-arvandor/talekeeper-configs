  entries:
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within
        range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to
        resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically
        succeeds on the save.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the
        same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be
        {@filter any beast|bestiary|type=beast|miscellaneous=!swarm} you have
        seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or
        half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating).
        The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are
        replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains
        its hit points, alignment, and personality.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit
        points of its new form. These temporary hit points can't be replaced by
        temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal
        form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell
        ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and
        reverts to its normal form.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of
        its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else that
        requires hands or speech.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate,
        use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
