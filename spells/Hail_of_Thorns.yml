      value: The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the
        spell ends, this spell creates a rain of thorns that sprouts from your
        ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the
        attack, the target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it
        must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 1d10}
        piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.
