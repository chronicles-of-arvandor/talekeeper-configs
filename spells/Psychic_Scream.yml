      value: You unleash the power of your mind to blast the intellect of up to ten
        creatures of your choice that you can see within range. Creatures that

      value: Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a
        target takes {@damage 14d6} psychic damage and is {@condition stunned}.
        On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't
        {@condition stunned}. If a target is killed by this damage, its head
        explodes, assuming it has one.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A {@condition stunned} target can make an Intelligence saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the stunning effect
        ends.
