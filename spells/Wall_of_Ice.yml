    value: You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it
      into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or
      you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each
      panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1
      foot thick and lasts for the duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature
      within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage
      10d6} cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12
      and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire
      damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and
      leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A
      creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a
      turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes {@damage
      5d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.
