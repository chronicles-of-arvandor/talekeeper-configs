    value: You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and
      orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spell—and as a bonus
      action on each of your turns thereafter—you can expend one or two of the
      meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within
      120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against
      a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the
      point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
      creature takes {@damage 2d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one.
