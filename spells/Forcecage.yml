    value: An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
      springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison
      can be a cage or a solid box as you choose.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is
      made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a
      solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and
      blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the
      cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those
      too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center of the
      area until they are completely outside the area.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the
      creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the
      cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the
      creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature
      can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage
      also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: This spell can't be dispelled by {@spell dispel magic}.
