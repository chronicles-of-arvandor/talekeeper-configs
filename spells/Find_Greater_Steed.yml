    value: "You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount.
      Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form
      you choose: a {@creature griffon}, a {@creature pegasus}, a {@creature
      peryton}, a {@creature dire wolf}, a {@creature rhinoceros}, or a
      {@creature saber-toothed tiger}. The creature has the statistics provided
      in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a
      fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type.
      Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its
      Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one
      language of your choice that you speak."
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you,
      you can communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can
      make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when
      you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the
      bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can't have more than one mount bonded by this spell or {@spell find
      steed} at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its
      bond, causing it to disappear permanently.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was
      wearing or carrying.
