    value: Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright
      light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can
      end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

    value: The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you
      choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the
      chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

    value: In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a
