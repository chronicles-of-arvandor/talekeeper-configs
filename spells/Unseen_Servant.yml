    value: This spell creates an {@condition invisible}, mindless, shapeless, Medium
      force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The
      servant springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within
      range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't
      attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command
      the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The servant
      can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching
      things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food,
      and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant performs the task
      to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for
      your next command.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than
      60 feet away from you, the spell ends.
