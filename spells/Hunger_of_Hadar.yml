      value: You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with
        unknown horrors. A 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold
        appears, centered on a point within range and lasting for the duration.
        This void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping
        noises that can be heard up to 30 feet away. No light, magical or
        otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area
        are {@condition blinded}.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the area is
        {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Any creature that starts its turn in
        the area takes {@damage 2d6} cold damage. Any creature that ends its
        turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
        {@damage 2d6} acid damage as milky, otherworldly tentacles rub against
        it.
