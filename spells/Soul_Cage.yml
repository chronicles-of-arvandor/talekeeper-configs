      value: This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside
        the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains
        inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage,
        which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can
        exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped
        soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is
        released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid
        it came from can't be revived.

        - You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain
          {@dice 2d8} hit points.

      name: Query Soul
      entries:
        - You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief
          telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language
          used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you
          truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than
          a sentence or two and might be cryptic.

      name: Borrow Experience
      entries:
        - You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul's life
          experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving
          throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit before the start
          of your next turn, it is lost.
    - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
      name: Eyes of the Dead
      entries:
        - You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which
          creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the
          plane of existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long
          as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were {@status
          concentration||concentrating} on a spell). You receive visual and
          auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using
          your senses.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using {@spell see
        invisibility} or {@sense truesight}) sees a translucent image of the
        tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.
