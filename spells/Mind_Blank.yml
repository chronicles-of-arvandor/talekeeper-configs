    value: Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic
      damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts,
      divination spells, and the {@condition charmed} condition. The spell even
      foils {@spell wish} spells and spells or effects of similar power used to
      affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.
