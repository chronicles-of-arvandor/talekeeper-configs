    value: You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The
      copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before,
      regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like
      you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears,
      and the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and
      make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics
      your mannerisms perfectly.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in
      its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its
      senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,
      you are {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened} in regard to your
      own surroundings.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
      things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the
      image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
      ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
      discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the
      image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.
