      value: "You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
        throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this
        spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:"
    - ==: ListSpellEntry
      items:
        - Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on
          ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
        - While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
        - While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start
          of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn
          doing nothing.
        - While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra
          {@damage 1d8} necrotic damage to the target.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A {@spell remove curse} spell ends this effect. At the DM's option, you
        may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more
        powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a
        curse's effect.

        - If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the
          duration is {@status concentration}, up to 10 minutes. If you use a
          spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use
          a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you
          use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.
          Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that
          doesn't require {@status concentration}.
