    value: You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range
      to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a
      circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can
      orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the
      duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel
      through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything
      that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the
      unoccupied space nearest to the portal.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell
      from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature
      (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a
      plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named
      creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the
      nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special
      power over the creature, and it is free to act as the DM deems
      appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.
