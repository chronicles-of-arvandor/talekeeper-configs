    value: You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see
      within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability
      check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell
      on itself to roll an additional {@dice d20} and choose which of the {@dice
      d20}s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the
      chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a {@dice d20}
      and choose which of the {@dice d20}s to use, the one it rolled or the one
      the attacker rolled.

    value: If the original {@dice d20} roll has advantage or disadvantage, the
      creature rolls the additional {@dice d20} after advantage or disadvantage
      has been applied to the original roll.
