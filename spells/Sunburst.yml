      value: Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you
        choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a
        Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage
        12d6} radiant damage and is {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a
        successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition
        blinded} by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this
        saving throw.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A creature {@condition blinded} by this spell makes another Constitution
        saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it
        is no longer {@condition blinded}.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
