    value: Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you
      choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 12d6} radiant
      damage and is {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a successful save, it
      takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded} by this spell.
      Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature {@condition blinded} by this spell makes another Constitution
      saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is
      no longer {@condition blinded}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
