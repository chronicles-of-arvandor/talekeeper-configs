      value: Seven star-like motes of light appear and orbit your head until the spell
        ends. You can use a bonus action to send one of the motes streaking
        toward one creature or object within 120 feet of you. When you do so,
        make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d12}
        radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, the mote is expended. The spell
        ends early if you expend the last mote.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you have four or more motes remaining, they shed bright light in a
        30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. If you have one
        to three motes remaining, they shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.
