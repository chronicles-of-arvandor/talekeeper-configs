    value: You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each
      humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within
      range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail
      this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw,
      choose one of the following two effects.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can suppress any effect causing a target to be {@condition charmed}
      or {@condition frightened}. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect
      resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your
      choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is
      attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being
      harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless
      the DM rules otherwise.
