    value: You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air
      inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and
      vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a
      Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes {@condition
      charmed} for the duration. While {@condition charmed} by this spell, the
      creature is {@condition incapacitated} and has a speed of 0.
