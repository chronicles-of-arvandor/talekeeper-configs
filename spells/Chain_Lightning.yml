      value: You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice
        that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to
        as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of
        the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be
        targeted by only one of the bolts.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes {@damage
        10d8} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
