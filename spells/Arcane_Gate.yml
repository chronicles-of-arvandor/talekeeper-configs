    value: You create linked teleportation portals that remain open for the
      duration. Choose two points on the ground that you can see, one point
      within 10 feet of you and one point within 500 feet of you. A circular
      portal, 10 feet in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal would
      open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and the casting
      is lost.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings filled with mist, hovering
      inches from the ground and perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A
      ring is visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side that
      functions as a portal.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Any creature or object entering the portal exits from the other portal as
      if the two were adjacent to each other; passing through a portal from the
      nonportal side has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque
      and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can rotate the rings as a
      bonus action so that the active side faces in a different direction.
