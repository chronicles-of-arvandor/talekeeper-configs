    value: You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The
      target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking {@damage 3d8} psychic
      damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a
      failed save, you also always know the target's location until the spell
      ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
      While you have this knowledge, the target can't become hidden from you,
      and if it's {@condition invisible}, it gains no benefit from that
      condition against you.
