    value: Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the spell ends, causing you to
      become heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10
      feet of you into darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim light.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Until the spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition,
      whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the
      shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it {@damage 2d8} necrotic
      damage.
