      value: Flame-like shadows wreathe your body until the spell ends, causing you to
        become heavily obscured to others. The shadows turn dim light within 10
        feet of you into darkness, and bright light in the same area to dim
        light.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Until the spell ends, you have resistance to radiant damage. In addition,
        whenever a creature within 10 feet of you hits you with an attack, the
        shadows lash out at that creature, dealing it {@damage 2d8} necrotic
        damage.
