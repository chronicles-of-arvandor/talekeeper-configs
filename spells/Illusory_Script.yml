    value: You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material
      and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the
      writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever meaning
      you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing appears
      as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is
      unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be
      an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language,
      though the language must be one you know.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both
      disappear.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature with {@sense truesight} can read the hidden message.
