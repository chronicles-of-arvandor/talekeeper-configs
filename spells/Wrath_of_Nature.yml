    value: You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies.
      Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks,
      and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated
      until the spell ends.

    name: Grasses and Undergrowth
    entries:
      - Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth
        is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for your enemies.

    name: Trees
    entries:
      - At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet
        of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take
        {@damage 4d6} slashing damage from whipping branches.

    name: Roots and Vines
    entries:
      - At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on
        the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become
        {@condition restrained} until the spell ends. A {@condition restrained}
        creature can use an action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check
        against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    name: Rocks
    entries:
      - As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube
        to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell
        attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d8}
        nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving
        throw or fall {@condition prone}.
