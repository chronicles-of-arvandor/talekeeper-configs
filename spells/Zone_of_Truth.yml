      value: You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a
        15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range.
        Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the
        first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma
        saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie
        while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on
        its saving throw.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering
        questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such creatures
        can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the
        boundaries of the truth.
