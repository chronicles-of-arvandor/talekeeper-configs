      value: You flick your wrist, causing one object in your hand to vanish. The
        object, which only you can be holding and can weigh no more than 5
        pounds, is transported to an extradimensional space, where it remains
        for the duration.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Until the spell ends, you can use your action to summon the object to
        your free hand, and you can use your action to return the object to the
        extradimensional space. An object still in the pocket plane when the
        spell ends appears in your space, at your feet.
