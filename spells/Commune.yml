    value: You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions
      that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before
      the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive
      "unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies
      beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be
      misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM might offer a
      short phrase as an answer instead.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
      rest, there is a cumulative {@chance 25|||No answer!|Answer} chance for
      each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this
      roll in secret.
