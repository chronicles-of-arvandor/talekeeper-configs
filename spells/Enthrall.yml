      value: You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice
        that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom
        saving throw. Any creature that can't be {@condition charmed} succeeds
        on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are
        fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the
        target has disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to
        perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the
        target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are {@condition
        incapacitated} or can no longer speak.
