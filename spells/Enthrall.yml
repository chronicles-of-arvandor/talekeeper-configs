    value: You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice
      that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom
      saving throw. Any creature that can't be {@condition charmed} succeeds on
      this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are
      fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the
      target has disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to
      perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the
      target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are {@condition
      incapacitated} or can no longer speak.
