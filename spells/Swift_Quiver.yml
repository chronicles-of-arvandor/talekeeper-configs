      value: You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless supply of nonmagical
        ammunition, which seems to leap into your hand when you reach for it.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action to
        make two attacks with a weapon that uses ammunition from the quiver.
        Each time you make such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces
        the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece of nonmagical
        ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition created by this spell disintegrate
        when the spell ends. If the quiver leaves your possession, the spell
        ends.
