      value: Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a
        30-foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when
        you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage
        on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack
        rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an
        undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes
        with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving
        throw or be {@condition blinded} until the spell ends.
