      value: You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it
        becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate
        when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set
        a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses
        this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken
        or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting {@spell knock} on the
        object suppresses {@spell arcane lock} for 10 minutes.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or
        force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
