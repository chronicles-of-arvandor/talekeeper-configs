    value: You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it
      becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when
      you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set a
      password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this
      spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken or the
      spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting {@spell knock} on the object
      suppresses {@spell arcane lock} for 10 minutes.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or
      force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
