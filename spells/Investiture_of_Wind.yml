      items:
        - Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage on the attack
          roll.
        - You gain a flying speed of 60 feet. If you are still flying when the
          spell ends, you fall, unless you can somehow prevent it.
        - You can use your action to create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind
          centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature
          in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes
          {@damage 2d10} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much
          damage on a successful one. If a Large or smaller creature fails the
          save, that creature is also pushed up to 10 feet away from the center
          of the cube.
