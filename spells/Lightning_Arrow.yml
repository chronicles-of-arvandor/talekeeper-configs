    value: The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell's
      duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the weapon itself if it's a thrown
      weapon, transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as
      normal. The target takes {@damage 4d8} lightning damage on a hit, or half
      as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's normal damage.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet of the target must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures takes {@damage 2d8}
      lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.
