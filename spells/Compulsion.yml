      value: Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear
        you must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on
        this saving throw if it can't be {@condition charmed}. On a failed save,
        a target is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a
        bonus action on each of your turns to designate a direction that is
        horizontal to you. Each affected target must use as much of its movement
        as possible to move in that direction on its next turn. It can take its
        action before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make another
        Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as
        a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the
        designated direction.
