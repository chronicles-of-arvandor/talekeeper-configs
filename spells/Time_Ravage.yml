      value: You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form
        through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a
        Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 10d12} necrotic damage on a
        failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save
        fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left
        before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has
        disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its
        walking speed is halved. Only the {@spell wish} spell or the {@spell
        greater restoration} cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these
        effects and restore the target to its previous age.
