    value: Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of
      heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the
      object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object
      takes {@damage 2d8} fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell
      ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause
      this damage again.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from
      it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the
      object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on
      attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.
