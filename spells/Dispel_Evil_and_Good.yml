    entries:
      - As your action, make a melee spell attack against a celestial, an
        elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On a hit, you
        attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The creature must
        succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its home plane (if
        it isn't there already). If they aren't on their home plane, undead are
        sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the Feywild.
