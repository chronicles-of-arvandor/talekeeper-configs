    value: The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell
      ends, your weapon crackles with force, and the attack deals an extra
      {@damage 5d10} force damage to the target. Additionally, if this attack
      reduces the target to 50 hit points or fewer, you banish it. If the target
      is native to a different plane of existence than the one you're on, the
      target disappears, returning to its home plane. If the target is native to
      the plane you're on, the creature vanishes into a harmless demiplane.
      While there, the target is {@condition incapacitated}. It remains there
      until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it
      left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
