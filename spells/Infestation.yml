    value: "You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear
      momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes {@damage 1d6} poison
      damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed
      is at least 5 feet. Roll a {@dice d4} for the direction: 1, north; 2,
      south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity
      attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move."

    value: The spell's damage increases by {@dice 1d6} when you reach 5th level
      ({@damage 2d6}), 11th level ({@damage 3d6}), and 17th level ({@damage
      4d6}).
