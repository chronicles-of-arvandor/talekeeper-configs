      value: "Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a
        comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the
        duration. Creatures that can't be {@condition charmed} are immune to
        this spell."
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving its
        space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls.
        While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have
        advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature
        makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful
        save, the spell ends.
