    value: You touch one willing creature and imbue it with the power to spew
      magical energy from its mouth, provided it has one. Choose acid, cold,
      fire, lightning, or poison. Until the spell ends, the creature can use an
      action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each
      creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage
      3d6} damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on
      a successful one.
