      value: You touch one willing creature and imbue it with the power to spew
        magical energy from its mouth, provided it has one. Choose acid, cold,
        fire, lightning, or poison. Until the spell ends, the creature can use
        an action to exhale energy of the chosen type in a 15-foot cone. Each
        creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking
        {@damage 3d6} damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as
        much damage on a successful one.
