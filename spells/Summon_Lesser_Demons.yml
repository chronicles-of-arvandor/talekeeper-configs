  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The DM chooses the demons, such as {@creature manes} or {@creature
      dretch||dretches}, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within
      range where they appear. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0
      hit points or when the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative
      for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns. The demons
      pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with
      the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to
      encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demons can't
      cross the circle or harm it, and they can't target anyone within it. Using
      the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.
