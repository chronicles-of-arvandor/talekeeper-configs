      value: You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the
        duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell,
        you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of
        the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to {@damage
        1d8} + your spellcasting ability modifier.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and
        repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

      value: The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are
        associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his
        mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that
        weapon.
