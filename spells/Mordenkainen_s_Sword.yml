    value: When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target of
      your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes
      {@damage 3d10} force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus
      action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you
      can see and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
