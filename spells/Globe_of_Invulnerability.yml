    value: An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a
      10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't
      affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a
      higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects
      within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the
      area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such
      spells.
