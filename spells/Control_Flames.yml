      value: "You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits
        within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:"
    - ==: ListSpellEntry
      items:
        - You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided
          that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.
        - You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.
        - You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the
          flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.
        - You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an
          inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and
          animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three
        non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can
        dismiss such an effect as an action.
