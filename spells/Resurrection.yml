      value: You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century,
        that didn't die of old age, and that isn't undead. If its soul is free
        and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting
        the creature when it died. It doesn't, however, remove magical diseases,
        curses, and the like; if such effects aren't removed prior to casting
        the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to
        all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the
        target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it
        disappears.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for
        one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you
        can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls,
        ability checks, and saving throws.
