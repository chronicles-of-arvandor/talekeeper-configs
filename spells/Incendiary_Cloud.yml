      value: A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears in a
        20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud
        spreads around corners and is {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||heavily
        obscured}. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or
        greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving
        throw. A creature takes {@damage 10d8} fire damage on a failed save, or
        half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this
        saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a
        turn or ends its turn there.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you
        choose at the start of each of your turns.
