        within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an
        additional 60 feet.

      value: If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn't being
        worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with it.
        Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such as a
        bowl or a helm, blocks the light.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by
        a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is
        dispelled.
