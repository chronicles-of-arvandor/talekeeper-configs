      value: One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on
        a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition charmed} by you for the
        duration. While the target is {@condition charmed} in this way, a
        twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in
        its eyes.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The {@condition charmed} target must use its action before moving on each
        of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself
        that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you
        choose no creature or if none are within its reach.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control
        over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom
        saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell
        ends.
