      value: You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and
        that died for any reason except old age. If the creature's soul is free
        and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all diseases,
        and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The spell
        replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs. If the creature was
        undead, it is restored to its non-undead form.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists,
        in which case you must speak the creature's name. The creature then
        appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.
