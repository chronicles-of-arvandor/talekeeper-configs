    value: You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a
      creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it
      need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take
      {@damage 1d4} psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll
      it makes before the end of its next turn.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry

      ({@damage 2d4}), 11th level ({@damage 3d4}), and 17th level ({@damage
      4d4}).
