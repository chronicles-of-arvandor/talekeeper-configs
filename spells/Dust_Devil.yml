    value: Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air that you can see within range. An
      elemental force that resembles a dust devil appears in the cube and lasts
      for the spell's duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make
      a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage
      1d8} bludgeoning damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil. On
      a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't
      pushed.

    value: As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any
      direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or light
      gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of
      debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The
      cloud heavily obscures its area.
