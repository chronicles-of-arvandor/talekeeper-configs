      value: You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.
        Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius
        and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you
        like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the
        light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature
        must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

    - DEXTERITY
