      value: You weave together threads of shadow to create a sword of solidified
        gloom in your hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. It
        counts as a simple melee weapon with which you are proficient. It deals
        {@damage 2d8} psychic damage on a hit and has the finesse, light, and
        thrown properties (range 20/60). In addition, when you use the sword to
        attack a target that is in dim light or darkness, you make the attack
        roll with advantage.

      value: If you drop the weapon or throw it, it dissipates at the end of the turn.
        Thereafter, while the spell persists, you can use a bonus action to
        cause the sword to reappear in your hand.
