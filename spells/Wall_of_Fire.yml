        wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall
        is opaque and lasts for the duration.

      value: When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a
        Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 5d8}
        fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

        when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn
