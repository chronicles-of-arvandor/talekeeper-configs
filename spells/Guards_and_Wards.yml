    value: You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space
      (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five
      10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as
      you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the
      area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while
      you are casting the spell.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected
      by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a
      password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these
      effects.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Corridors
    entries:
      - Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them {@quickref Vision and
        Light|PHB|2||heavily obscured}. In addition, at each intersection or
        branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a {@chance
        50|||Disoriented!|No effect} chance that a creature other than you will
        believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Doors
    entries:
      - All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an
        {@spell arcane lock} spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors
        with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the
        {@spell minor illusion} spell) to make them appear as plain sections of
        wall.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Stairs
    entries:
      - Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the
        {@spell web} spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are
        burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Other Spell Effect
    entries:
      - You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within
        the warded area of the stronghold.
      - type: list
        items:
          - Place {@spell dancing lights} in four corridors. You can designate a
            simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards
            lasts.
          - Place {@spell magic mouth} in two locations.
          - Place {@spell stinking cloud} in two locations. The vapors appear in
            the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed
            by wind while guards and wards lasts.
          - Place a constant {@spell gust of wind} in one corridor or room.
          - Place a {@spell suggestion} in one location. You select an area of
            up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through
            the area receives the suggestion mentally.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The whole warded area radiates magic. A {@spell dispel magic} cast on a
      specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this
      spell there every day for one year.
