      value: You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the
        spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you
        learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement
        to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any
        spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created
        by a spell, you learn which spell created it.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what
        spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
