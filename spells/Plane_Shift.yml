    value: You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are
      transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target
      destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental
      Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine
      Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to
      reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of
      Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the
      Sea of Fire, at the DM's discretion.

    value: Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle
      on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If
      the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you
      transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the
      circle.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.
      Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against
      it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the
      creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the
      plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its
      own way back to your current plane of existence.
