    value: You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on
      a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is
      {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||heavily obscured}. The cloud lingers in
      the air for the duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its
      turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed
      save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling.
      Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically
      succeed on this saving throw.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4
      rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1
      round.
