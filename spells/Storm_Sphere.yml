    value: A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered
      on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's
      duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its
      turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take {@damage 2d6}
      bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is {@quickref difficult
      terrain||3}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to
      cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one
      creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell
      attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the
      sphere. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d6} lightning damage.

    value: Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom
