    value: You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog
      centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around
      corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog,
      ending the spell. Its area is {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||heavily
      obscured}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or
      starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving
      throw. The creature takes {@damage 5d8} poison damage on a failed save, or
      half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if
      they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns,
      rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than
      air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.
