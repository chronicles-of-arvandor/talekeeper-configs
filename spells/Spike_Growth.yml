    value: The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists
      and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes {@quickref difficult
      terrain||3} for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the
      area, it takes {@damage 2d4} piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any
      creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a
      Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check against your spell save DC to recognize
      the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
