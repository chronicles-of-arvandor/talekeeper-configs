    value: You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with
      which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of
      existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the
      same plane.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words,
      images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the
      link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating
      with. The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at least
      1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any
      sensory messages you send to it.
