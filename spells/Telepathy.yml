      value: You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with
        which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane
        of existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer
        on the same plane.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words,
        images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the
        link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating
        with. The spell enables a creature with an Intelligence score of at
        least 1 to understand the meaning of your words and take in the scope of
        any sensory messages you send to it.
