    value: A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of
      your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere
      centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
      takes {@damage 3d8} thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as
      stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

    value: A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the
      damage if it's in the spell's area.
