      value: You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of
        magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the
        duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet
        high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20
        feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to
        creatures behind it, and its space is {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.
