      value: You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance
        of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral
        form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear
        fiendish.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you
        can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature's speed is halved
        in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on
        a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
        a failed save, the creature takes {@damage 3d8} radiant damage (if you
        are good or neutral) or {@damage 3d8} necrotic damage (if you are evil).
        On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
