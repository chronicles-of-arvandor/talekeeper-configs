    value: You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within
      range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with
      the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 1d8} necrotic
      damage, and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn.
      Until then, the hand clings to the target.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls
      against you until the end of your next turn.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry

      4d8}).
