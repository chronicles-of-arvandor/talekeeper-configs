      value: Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you
        can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered
        on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere
        spreads around corners. A creature takes {@damage 20d6} fire damage and
        {@damage 20d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one
        fiery burst is affected only once.
