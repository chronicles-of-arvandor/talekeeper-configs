      value: You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends,
        any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful
        spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
        creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This
        spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the
        explosion of a {@spell fireball}.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an
        enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.
