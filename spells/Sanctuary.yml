    value: You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends,
      any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful
      spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell
      doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the
      explosion of a {@spell fireball}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell that affects an
      enemy, or deals damage to another creature, this spell ends.
