      value: Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw 
        or drop whatever it is holding and become {@condition frightened} for the 
        duration.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While {@condition frightened} by this spell, a creature must take the
        {@action Dash} action and move away from you by the safest available
        route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the
        creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight
        to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful
        save, the spell ends for that creature.
