    value: You choose an area of stone or mud that you can see that fits within a
      40-foot cube and is within range, and choose one of the following effects.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Transmute Rock to Mud
    entries:
      - Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of
        thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can
      sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet
      of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must
      make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw
      when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn
      there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is {@condition
      restrained}, though it can use an action to end the {@condition
      restrained} condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the
      mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes
      {@damage 4d8} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
      on a successful one.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Transmute Mud to Rock
    entries:
      - Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep
        transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the
        mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
        successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an
        unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes {@condition
        restrained} by the rock. A {@condition restrained} creature, or another
        creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by
        succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The
        rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic
        damage.
