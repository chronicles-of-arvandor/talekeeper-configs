    value: Choose a point you can see on the ground within range. A fountain of
      churned earth and stone erupts in a 20-foot cube centered on that point.
      Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
      takes {@damage 3d12} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one. Additionally, the ground in that area becomes
      {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion
      of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
