    value: You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a
      spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual;
      it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within
      range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that
      its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an
      image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it
      appears to be walking.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
      things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the
      image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
      ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
      discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the
      image.
