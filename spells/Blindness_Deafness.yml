      value: You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see
        within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the
        target is either {@condition blinded} or {@condition deafened} (your
        choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target
        can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
