    value: You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see
      within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the target
      is either {@condition blinded} or {@condition deafened} (your choice) for
      the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.
