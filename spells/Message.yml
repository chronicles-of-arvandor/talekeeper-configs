      value: You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a
        message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can
        reply in a whisper that only you can hear.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with
        the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of
        stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
        blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and
        can travel freely around corners or through openings.
