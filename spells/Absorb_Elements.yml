      value: The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on
        you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to
        the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the
        first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target
        takes an extra {@damage 1d6} damage of the triggering type, and the
        spell ends.
