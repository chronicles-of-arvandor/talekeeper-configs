      value: You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same
        plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw,
        which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of
        physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting
        this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be
        observed.

      value: On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this
        spell against it again for 24 hours.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of
        the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were
        there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it
        for the duration. A creature that can see {@condition invisible} objects
        sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen
        before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at
        that location and doesn't move.
