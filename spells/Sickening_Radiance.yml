      value: Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a
        point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it
        lasts until the spell ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn
        or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution
        saving throw or take {@damage 4d10} radiant damage, and it suffers one
        level of {@condition exhaustion} and emits a dim, greenish light in a
        5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to
        benefit from being {@condition invisible}. The light and any levels of
        {@condition exhaustion} caused by this spell go away when the spell
        ends.
