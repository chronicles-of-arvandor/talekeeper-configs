      value: You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as
        your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra {@damage 1d6}
        damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you
        have advantage on any Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) or Wisdom ({@skill
        Survival}) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit
        points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a
        subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.
