    value: You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by you for the
      duration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it
      has advantage on the saving throw.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: While the creature is {@condition charmed}, you have a telepathic link
      with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You
      can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you
      are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You
      can specify a simple and general course of action, such as "Attack that
      creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." If the creature
      completes the order and doesn't receive further direction from you, it
      defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
      Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you
      choose, and doesn't do anything that you don't allow it to do. During this
      time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires
      you to use your own reaction as well.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw
      against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.
