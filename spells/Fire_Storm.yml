    value: A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you
      choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot
      cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one
      face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes {@damage 7d10} fire damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    value: The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
