    value: A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses
      to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the
      duration. When the spell ends, either because your {@status concentration}
      is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low
      roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each creature
      in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated
      damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The spell's base damage is {@damage 12d6}. If at the end of your turn the
      bead has not yet detonated, the damage increases by {@dice 1d6}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the
      creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
      the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a
      successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it
      strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead
      explodes.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
      aren't being worn or carried.
