    value: Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must
      make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving
      throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the
      target must roll a {@dice d4} and subtract the number rolled from the
      attack roll or saving throw.
