      value: You teleport yourself to an unoccupied space you can see within range.
        Immediately after you disappear, a thunderous boom sounds, and each
        creature within 10 feet of the space you left must make a Constitution
        saving throw, taking {@damage 3d10} thunder damage on a failed save, or
        half as much damage on a successful one. The thunder can be heard from
        up to 300 feet away.

        creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell, and
