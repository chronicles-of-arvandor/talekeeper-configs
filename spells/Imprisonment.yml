entries:
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see within
      range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be bound by the
      spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you cast it again.
      While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat,
      or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't locate or perceive
      the target.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of
      imprisonment.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Burial
    entries:
      - The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a sphere of magical
        force that is just large enough to contain the target. Nothing can pass
        through the sphere, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel
        to get into or out of it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral orb.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Chaining
    entries:
      - Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the target in place. The
        target is {@condition restrained} until the spell ends, and it can't
        move or be moved by any means until then.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of
      precious metal.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Hedged Prison
    entries:
      - The spell transports the target into a tiny demiplane that is warded
        against teleportation and planar travel. The demiplane can be a
        labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of
        your choice.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature
      representation of the prison made from jade.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Minimus Containment
    entries:
      - The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a
        gemstone or similar object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally
        (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but
        nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar
        travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in
        effect.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The special component for this version of the spell is a large,
      transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Slumber
    entries:
      - The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The special component for this version of the spell consists of rare
      soporific herbs.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Ending the Spell
    entries:
      - During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify
        a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The
        condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM
        must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of
        coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name,
        identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable actions or
        qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or hit
        points.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A {@spell dispel magic} spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a
      9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used
      to create it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a
      time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of
      the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.
