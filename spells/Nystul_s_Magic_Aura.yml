      value: You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that
        divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a
        willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by
        another creature.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The
        effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same
        creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it
        each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

      name: False Aura
      entries:
        - You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects,
          such as {@spell detect magic}, that detect magical auras. You can make
          a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear
          nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to
          belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use
          this effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any
          creature that handles the item.

      entries:
        - You change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects
          that detect creature types, such as a paladin's {@classFeature Divine
          Sense|Paladin|PHB|1} or the trigger of a {@spell symbol} spell. You
          choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the
          target as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.
