    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot
        radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope
        disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence
        ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC to be
        discerned.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the
        ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on
        a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving
        it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The
        creature is {@condition restrained} there until the spell ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A {@condition restrained} creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an
        action to make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check against your
        spell save DC. On a success, the {@condition restrained} effect ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is
        {@condition restrained} by it.
