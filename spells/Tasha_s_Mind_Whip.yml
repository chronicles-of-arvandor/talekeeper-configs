    value: You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The
      target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
      target takes {@damage 3d6} psychic damage, and it can't take a reaction
      until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose
      whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of
      the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and
      suffers none of the spell's other effects.
