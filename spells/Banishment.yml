    value: You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another
      plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or
      be banished.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish
      the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is {@condition
      incapacitated}. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which
      point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
      unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one
      you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to
      its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target
      reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that
      space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.
