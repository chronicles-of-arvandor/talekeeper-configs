      value: "Purifying energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius.
        Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each
        nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) can't become diseased,
        has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws
        against effects that cause any of the following conditions: {@condition
        blinded}, {@condition charmed}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition
        frightened}, {@condition paralyzed}, {@condition poisoned}, and
        {@condition stunned}."
