      value: You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the
        spell ends, the magic bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the
        bonfire's space when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity
        saving throw or take {@damage 1d8} fire damage. A creature must also
        make the saving throw when it moves into the bonfire's space for the
        first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

      value: The bonfire ignites flammable objects in its area that aren't being worn
