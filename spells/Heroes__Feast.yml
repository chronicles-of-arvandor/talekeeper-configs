    value: You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The
      feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and
      the beneficial effects don't set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve
      creatures can partake of the feast.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The
      creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and
      being {@condition frightened}, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with
      advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by {@dice 2d10}, and it
      gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.
