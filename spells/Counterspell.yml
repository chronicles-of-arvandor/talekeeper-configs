    value: You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If
      the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and
      has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an
      ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the
      spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.
