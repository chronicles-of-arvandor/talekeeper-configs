    value: A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and
      spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder
      booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than
      5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d6} thunder
      damage and becomes {@condition deafened} for 5 minutes.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Each round you maintain {@status concentration} on this spell, the storm
      produces different effects on your turn.

    entries:
      - Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the
        cloud takes {@damage 1d6} acid damage.

    name: Round 3
    entries:
      - You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures
        or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given creature or object
        can't be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a
        Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes {@damage 10d6} lightning
        damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    name: Round 4
    entries:
      - Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes
        {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Round 5â€“10
    entries:
      - Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the cloud. The area
        becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} and is {@quickref Vision and
        Light|PHB|2||heavily obscured}. Each creature there takes {@damage 1d6}
        cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible. The wind
        and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining
        {@status concentration} on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind
        (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog,
        mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.
