      value: You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other
        belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until
        you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller
        and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body
        type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of
        limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.
        For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects
        pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or
        would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner
        than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would
        bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to
        inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence ({@skill
        Investigation}) check against your spell save DC.
