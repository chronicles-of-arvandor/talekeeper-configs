    value: A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your
      companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose
      within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity
      ({@skill Stealth}) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A
      creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other traces
      of its passage.
