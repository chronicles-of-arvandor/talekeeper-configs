      value: You create intense pressure, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide
        whether the pressure pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each
        creature in that cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
        takes {@damage 6d6} force damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. And every creature that fails the save is
        either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away from you,
        depending on the choice you made for the spell.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the cone are
        likewise pulled or pushed 15 feet.
