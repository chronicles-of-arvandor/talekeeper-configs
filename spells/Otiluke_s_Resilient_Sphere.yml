    value: A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size
      or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass
      through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can
      breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or
      object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from
      outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or
      object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the
      sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's
      speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A {@spell disintegrate} spell targeting the globe destroys it without
      harming anything inside it.
