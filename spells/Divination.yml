    value: Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's
      servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or
      activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply
      might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might
      change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss
      or gain of a companion.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
      rest, there is a cumulative {@chance 25|||Random reading!|Regular reading}
      chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The
      DM makes this roll in secret.
