    value: This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder
      centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren't
      somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top
      of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity
      saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the
      fall.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,
      falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a normal
      downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area
      without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the
      duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back down.
