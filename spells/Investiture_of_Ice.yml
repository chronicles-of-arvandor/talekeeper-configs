      items:
        - You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage.
        - You can move across {@quickref difficult terrain||3} created by ice or
          snow without spending extra movement.
        - The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is {@quickref
          difficult terrain||3} for creatures other than you. The radius moves
          with you.
        - You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind
          extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each
          creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
          takes {@damage 4d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half as much
          damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against
          this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn.
