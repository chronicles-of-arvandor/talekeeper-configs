    value: "Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or
      Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following
      benefits until the spell ends:"
  - ==: ListSpellEntry
    items:
      - You are immune to fire and poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and
        necrotic damage (Upper Planes).
      - You are immune to the {@condition poisoned} condition (Lower Planes) or
        the {@condition charmed} condition (Upper Planes).
      - Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a flying speed of 40 feet.
      - You have a +2 bonus to AC.
      - All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack,
        you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or
        Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
      - You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the {@action
        Attack} action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have
        a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when
        you take the Attack action on your turn.
