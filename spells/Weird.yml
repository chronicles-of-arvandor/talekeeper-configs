    value: Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory
      creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a
      30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must
      make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes
      {@condition frightened} for the duration. The illusion calls on the
      creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an
      implacable threat. At the end of each of the {@condition frightened}
      creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take
      {@damage 4d10} psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for
      that creature.
