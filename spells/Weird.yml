      value: Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory
        creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a
        30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range
        must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes
        {@condition frightened} for the duration. The illusion calls on the
        creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an
        implacable threat. At the end of each of the {@condition frightened}
        creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take
        {@damage 4d10} psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for
        that creature.
