    value: You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot
      cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
      affected by this spell for the duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a âˆ’2 penalty to AC and
      Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can
      use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the
      creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or
      ranged attack during its turn.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action,
      roll a {@dice d20}. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect
      until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on
      that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at
      the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends for
      it.
