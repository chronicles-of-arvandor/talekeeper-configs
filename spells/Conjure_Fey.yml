    value: You summon a {@filter fey creature of challenge rating 6 or
      lower|bestiary|challenge rating=[&0;&6]|type=fey|miscellaneous=!swarm}, or
      a fey spirit that takes the form of a {@filter beast of challenge rating 6
      or lower|bestiary|challenge
      rating=[&0;&6]|type=beast|miscellaneous=!swarm}. It appears in an
      unoccupied space that you can see within range. The fey creature
      disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The fey creature is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
      Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any
      verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as long
      as they don't violate its alignment. If you don't issue any commands to
      the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise
      takes no actions.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If your {@status concentration} is broken, the fey creature doesn't
      disappear. Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes
      hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An
      uncontrolled fey creature can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1
      hour after you summoned it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The DM has the fey creature's statistics.
