    value: A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives
      everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this
      spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall
      {@condition prone}, becoming {@condition incapacitated} and unable to
      stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or
      less isn't affected.

      ends.
