      value: The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell
        ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact,
        and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be {@condition
        restrained} by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger
        creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on
        the save, the vines shrivel away.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While {@condition restrained} by this spell, the target takes {@damage
        1d6} piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature
        {@condition restrained} by the vines or one that can touch the creature
        can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.
        On a success, the target is freed.
