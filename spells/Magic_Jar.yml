  entries:
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters
        the container you used for the spell's material component. While your
        soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if
        you were in the container's space. You can't move or use reactions. The
        only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of
        the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the
        spell) or attempting to possess a humanoid's body.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you
        can see (creatures warded by a {@spell protection from evil and good} or
        {@spell magic circle} spell can't be possessed). The target must make a
        Charisma saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's
        body, and the target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a
        success, the target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't
        attempt to possess it again for 24 hours.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics
        are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your
        alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain
        the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class
        levels, you can't use any of its class features.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container
        using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host
        body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the
        host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in
        it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against
        your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if
        it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately
        returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you
        or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If
        another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the
        creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100
        feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.
