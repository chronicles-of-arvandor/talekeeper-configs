      value: You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee
        attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the
        target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects, and you can cause
        green fire to leap from the target to a different creature of your
        choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes
        fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th
        level, the melee attack deals an extra {@damage 1d8} fire damage to the
        target on a hit, and the fire damage to the second creature increases to
        {@damage 1d8} + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls
        increase by {@damage 1d8} at 11th level ({@damage 2d8} and {@damage
        2d8}) and 17th level ({@damage 3d8} and {@damage 3d8}).
