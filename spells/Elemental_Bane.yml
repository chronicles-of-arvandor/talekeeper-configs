      value: "Choose one creature you can see within range, and choose one of the
        following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The
        target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be affected by the
        spell for its duration. The first time each turn the affected target
        takes damage of the chosen type, the target takes an extra {@damage 2d6}
        damage of that type. Moreover, the target loses any resistance to that
        damage type until the spell ends."
