      value: You cause numbing frost to form on one creature that you can see within
        range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
        save, the target takes {@damage 1d6} cold damage, and it has
        disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of
        its next turn.
