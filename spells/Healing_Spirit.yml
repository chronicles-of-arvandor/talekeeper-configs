    value: You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible
      spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range.
      The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into
      the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
      you can cause the spirit to restore {@dice 1d6} hit points to that
      creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead.
      The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting
      ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times,
      the spirit disappears.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to
      a space you can see.
