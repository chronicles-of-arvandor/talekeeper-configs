      value: Divine energy radiates from you, distorting and diffusing magical energy
        within 30 feet of you. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you,
        centered on you. For the duration, each friendly creature in the area
        (including you) has advantage on saving throws against spells and other
        magical effects. Additionally, when an affected creature succeeds on a
        saving throw made against a spell or magical effect that allows it to
        make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage
        if it succeeds on the saving throw.
