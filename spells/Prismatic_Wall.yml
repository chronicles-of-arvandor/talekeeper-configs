    value: A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque wall—up
      to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you
      can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere
      up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. The
      wall remains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that
      it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and
      your action and the spell slot are wasted.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for
      an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you
      cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If
      another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or
      starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving
      throw or become {@condition blinded} for 1 minute.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a
      creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one
      layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches
      through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be
      affected by that layer's properties as described below.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to
      violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it
      remains so for the duration of the spell. An {@spell antimagic field} has
      no effect on a prismatic wall.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Red
    entries:
      - The creature takes {@damage 10d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half
        as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place,
        nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be
        destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Orange
    entries:
      - The creature takes {@damage 10d6} acid damage on a failed save, or half
        as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place,
        magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is
        destroyed by a strong wind.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Yellow
    entries:
      - The creature takes {@damage 10d6} lightning damage on a failed save, or
        half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by
        dealing at least 60 force damage to it.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Green
    entries:
      - The creature takes {@damage 10d6} poison damage on a failed save, or
        half as much damage on a successful one. A {@spell passwall} spell, or
        another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a
        solid surface, destroys this layer.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Blue
    entries:
      - The creature takes {@damage 10d6} cold damage on a failed save, or half
        as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by
        dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Indigo
    entries:
      - On a failed save, the creature is {@condition restrained}. It must then
        make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it
        successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save
        three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the
        {@condition petrified} condition. The successes and failures don't need
        to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three
        of a kind.
      - While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast through the wall. The
        layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a {@spell daylight} spell or
        a similar spell of equal or higher level.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Violet
    entries:
      - On a failed save, the creature is {@condition blinded}. It must then
        make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful
        save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is
        transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer
        {@condition blinded}. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that
        isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually
        cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a
        {@spell dispel magic} spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level
        that can end spells and magical effects.
