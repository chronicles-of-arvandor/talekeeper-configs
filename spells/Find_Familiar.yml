      value: "You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form
        you choose: {@creature bat}, {@creature cat}, {@creature crab},
        {@creature frog} (toad), {@creature hawk}, {@creature lizard},
        {@creature octopus}, {@creature owl}, {@creature poisonous snake}, fish
        ({@creature quipper}), {@creature rat}, {@creature raven}, {@creature
        sea horse}, {@creature spider}, or {@creature weasel}. Appearing in an
        unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the
        chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice)
        instead of a beast."
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: "{@note Additional {@filter animal form
        choices|bestiary|Miscellaneous=Familiar} may be available at the DM's
        discretion.}"
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your
        commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own
        turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no
        physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an
        action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension.
        Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is
        temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied
        space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points
        or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space
        anything it was wearing or carrying.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with
        it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your
        familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next
        turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has.
        During this time, you are {@condition deafened||deaf} and {@condition
        blinded||blind} with regard to your own senses.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell
        while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new
        form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar
        transforms into the chosen creature.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can
        deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be
        within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the
        spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use
        your attack modifier for the roll.
