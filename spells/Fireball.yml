    value: A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose
      within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.
      Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make
      a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes {@damage 8d6} fire damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    value: The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area
      that aren't being worn or carried.
