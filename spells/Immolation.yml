    value: Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must
      make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes {@damage 8d6} fire damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save,
      the target also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target sheds
      bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
      At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It
      takes {@damage 4d6} fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a
      successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical
      means.
