      value: You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within
        range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving
        throw, taking {@damage 5d12} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half
        as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises
        up as a {@creature zombie} at the start of your next turn. The zombie
        pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics
        for the {@creature zombie} are in the Monster Manual.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving
        throw. Instead, roll {@dice 5d12}. The target gains half the total as
        temporary hit points.
