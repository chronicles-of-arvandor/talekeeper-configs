    value: You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must
      touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material
      component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of
      nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and
      touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space
      on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the
      Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the
      replica.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: After 60 days, there is a cumulative {@chance 5|||Effect ends!|Effect
      continues} chance per day that the spell's effect ends. This effect ends
      if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed,
      or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the
      larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.
