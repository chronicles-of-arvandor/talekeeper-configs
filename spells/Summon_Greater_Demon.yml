  entries:

      value: You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss.
        You choose the demon's type, which must be {@filter one of challenge
        rating 5 or lower|bestiary|challenge
        rating=[&0;&5]|tag=demon|miscellaneous=!swarm}, such as a {@creature
        shadow demon} or a {@creature barlgura}. The demon appears in an
        unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when
        it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon
        it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command
        to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on
        its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any
        creature within reach that has attacked it.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma saving
        throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its
        true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a
        successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the
        duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the
        nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop {@status
        concentration||concentrating} on the spell before it reaches its full
        duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for {@dice 1d6} rounds
        if it still has hit points.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with
        the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to
        encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't
        cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using
        the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.
