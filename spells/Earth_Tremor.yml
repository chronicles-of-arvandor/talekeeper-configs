      value: You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than
        you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
        creature takes {@damage 1d6} bludgeoning damage and is knocked
        {@condition prone}. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone,
        it becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until cleared, with each
        5-foot-diameter portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
