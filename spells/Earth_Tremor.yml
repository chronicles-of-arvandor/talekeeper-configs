    value: You cause a tremor in the ground within range. Each creature other than
      you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
      creature takes {@damage 1d6} bludgeoning damage and is knocked {@condition
      prone}. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes
      {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until cleared, with each 5-foot-diameter
      portion requiring at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
