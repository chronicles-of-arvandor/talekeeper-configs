    value: You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is
      unaffected by {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and spells and other
      magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the target
      to be {@condition paralyzed} or {@condition restrained}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from
      nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it
      {@condition grappled}. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on
      the target's movement or attacks.
