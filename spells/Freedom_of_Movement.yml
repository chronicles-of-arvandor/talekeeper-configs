      value: You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is
        unaffected by {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and spells and other
        magical effects can neither reduce the target's speed nor cause the
        target to be {@condition paralyzed} or {@condition restrained}.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from
        nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it
        {@condition grappled}. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on
        the target's movement or attacks.
