  - ==: ListSpellEntry
    items:
      - The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If
        the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so,
        it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.
      - The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the
        cylinder.
      - Targets within the cylinder can't be {@condition charmed}, {@condition
        frightened}, or possessed by the creature.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in
      the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from
      leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.
