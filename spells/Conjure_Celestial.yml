      value: You summon a {@filter celestial of challenge rating 4 or

        rating=[&0;&4]|type=celestial|miscellaneous=!swarm}, which appears in an
        unoccupied space that you can see within range. The celestial disappears
        when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The celestial is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
        Roll initiative for the celestial, which has its own turns. It obeys any
        verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you), as
        long as they don't violate its alignment. If you don't issue any
        commands to the celestial, it defends itself from hostile creatures but
        otherwise takes no actions.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The DM has {@creature couatl||the celestial}'s statistics.
