    value: Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see
      within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make
      a Constitution saving throw. The target takes {@damage 8d8} necrotic
      damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This
      spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving
      throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree or
      shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw, it simply withers and dies.
