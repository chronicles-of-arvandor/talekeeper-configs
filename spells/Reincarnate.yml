      value: You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that
        the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new
        adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the
        target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely
        causes the creature's race to change. The DM rolls a {@dice d100} and
        consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes
        when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.

        retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it
        exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial
        traits accordingly.
