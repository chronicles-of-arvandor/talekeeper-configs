    value: You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice
      within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the
      duration. The webs are {@quickref difficult terrain||3} and lightly
      obscure their area.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or
      trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web
      collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
      Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during
      its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
      creature is {@condition restrained} as long as it remains in the webs or
      until it breaks free.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature {@condition restrained} by the webs can use its action to make
      a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no
      longer {@condition restrained}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns
      away in 1 round, dealing {@damage 2d4} fire damage to any creature that
      starts its turn in the fire.
