      value: "You call forth a {@creature draconic spirit|FTD}. It manifests in an
        unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses
        the Draconic Spirit stat block. When you cast this spell, choose a
        family of dragon: chromatic, gem, or metallic. The creature resembles a
        dragon of the chosen family, which determines certain traits in its stat
        block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the
        spell ends."
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the
        creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
        after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you).
        If you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its
        move to avoid danger.
