    value: The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the
      spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the
      attack deals an extra {@damage 1d6} fire damage to the target and causes
      the target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until
      the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
      failed save, it takes {@damage 1d6} fire damage. On a successful save, the
      spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action
      to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as
      the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.
