    value: You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some
      other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar
      intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell,
      make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take {@damage
      6d6} psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While
      insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say,
      can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A {@spell greater restoration}
      spell cast on you ends this effect.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You
      must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each
      question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never,"
      "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the
      question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead
      offer a short phrase as an answer.
