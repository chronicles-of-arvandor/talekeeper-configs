    value: One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range
      rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the
      duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An
      unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is
      unaffected.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or
      surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to
      move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to
      20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can
      move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action
      to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is
      still aloft.
