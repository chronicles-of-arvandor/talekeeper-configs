      value: You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been
        dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and
        at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit
        point.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases
        that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't,
        however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these
        aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when
        the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature
        to life.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body
        parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its
        survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to
        all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the
        target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it
        disappears.
