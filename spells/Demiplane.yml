      value: You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see within
        range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass
        through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that
        appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or
        stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or
        objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also
        disappears from the other side.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have
        the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous
        casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents
        of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature,
        you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.
