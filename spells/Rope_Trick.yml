    value: You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the
      rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to
      the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to
      an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the
      rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The
      rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from view
      outside the space.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance into or out of the
      extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through a
      3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends.
