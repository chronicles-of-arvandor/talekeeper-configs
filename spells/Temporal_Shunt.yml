    value: You target the triggering creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw or vanish, being thrown to another point in time and causing the
      attack to miss or the spell to be wasted. At the start of its next turn,
      the target reappears where it was or in the closest unoccupied space. The
      target doesn't remember you casting the spell or being affected by it.
