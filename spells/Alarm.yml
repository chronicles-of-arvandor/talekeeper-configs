    value: You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or
      an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. Until the
      spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches
      or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate
      creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm
      is mental or audible.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1
      mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within
      60 feet.
