    value: You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear
      as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the
      duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely
      humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds
      dim light in a 10-foot radius.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to
      a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light
      created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's
      range.
