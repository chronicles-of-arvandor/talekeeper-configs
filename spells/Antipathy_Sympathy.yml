    value: This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target
      something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an
      area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of
      intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You
      invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the
      specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the
      aura's effect.

    name: Antipathy
    entries:
      - The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an
        intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a
        creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature
        must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened}.
        The creature remains {@condition frightened} while it can see the target
        or is within 60 feet of it. While {@condition frightened} by the target,
        the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from
        which it can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet
        from the target and can't see it, the creature is no longer {@condition
        frightened}, but the creature becomes {@condition frightened} again if
        it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.

    name: Sympathy
    entries:
      - The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge
        to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it.
        When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it,
        the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement
        on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the
        target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move away from
        the target.
      - If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the
        affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as
        described below.

    name: Ending the Effect
    entries:
      - If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the
        target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a
        successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and
        recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In
        addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom
        saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it
      for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.
