      value: You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For
        example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope
        from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a
        Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight
        connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If
        you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance,
        however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained
        within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell
        is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Creatures or magic items can't be created or transmuted by this spell.
        You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high
        degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor,
        unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan's tools used to
        craft such objects.
