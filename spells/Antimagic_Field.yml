  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area
      is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within
      the sphere, spells can't be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even
      magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with
      you, centered on you.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or
      a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can't protrude into it. A slot
      expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
      suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time it spends suppressed counts
      against its duration.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Targeted Effects
    entries:
      - Spells and other magical effects, such as {@spell magic missile} and
        {@spell charm person}, that target a creature or an object in the sphere
        have no effect on that target.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Areas of Magic
    entries:
      - The area of another spell or magical effect, such as {@spell fireball},
        can't extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic,
        the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For
        example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the
        sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Spells
    entries:
      - Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in
        the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Magic Items
    entries:
      - The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.
        For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical
        longsword.
      - A magic weapon's properties and powers are suppressed if it is used
        against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.
        If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
        (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a
        target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be
        suppressed as soon as it exits.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Magical Travel
    entries:
      - Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the
        sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical
        travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as
        well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by
        the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Creatures and Objects
    entries:
      - A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out
        of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the
        space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Dispel Magic
    entries:
      - Spells and magical effects such as {@spell dispel magic} have no effect
        on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different {@spell
        antimagic field} spells don't nullify each other.
