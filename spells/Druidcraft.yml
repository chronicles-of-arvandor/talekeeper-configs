      items:
        - You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts what the
          weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect
          might manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain,
          falling snowflakes for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1
          round.
        - You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud
          bloom.
        - You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling
          leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor
          of skunk. The effect must fit in a 5-foot cube.
        - You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small
          campfire.
