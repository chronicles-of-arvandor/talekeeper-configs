      value: The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this
        spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack
        deals an extra {@damage 4d6} psychic damage to the target. The target
        must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage
        on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the
        end of its next turn.
