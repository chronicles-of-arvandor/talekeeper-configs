    value: "You call forth an undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
      that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the {@creature
      Undead Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the
      creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an
      undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain traits in
      its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or
      when the spell ends."
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the
      creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
      after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If
      you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its move
      to avoid danger.
