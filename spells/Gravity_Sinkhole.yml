    value: A 20-foot-radius sphere of crushing force forms at a point you can see
      within range and tugs at the creatures there. Each creature in the sphere
      must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
      takes {@damage 5d10} force damage and is pulled in a straight line toward
      the center of the sphere, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the
      center as possible (even if that space is in the air). On a successful
      save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.
