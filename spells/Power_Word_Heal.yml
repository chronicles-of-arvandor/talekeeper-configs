    value: A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target
      regains all its hit points. If the creature is {@condition charmed},
      {@condition frightened}, {@condition paralyzed}, or {@condition stunned},
      the condition ends. If the creature is {@condition prone}, it can use its
      reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
