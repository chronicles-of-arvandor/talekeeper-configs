    value: A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within
      range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target.
      Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target
      takes {@damage 1d12} lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the
      duration, you can use your action to deal {@damage 1d12} lightning damage
      to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do
      anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the
      spell's range or if it has total cover from you.
