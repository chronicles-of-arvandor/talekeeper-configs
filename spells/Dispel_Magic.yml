      value: Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of
        3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or
        higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting
        ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check,
        the spell ends.
