    value: Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot
      radius. Until the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you.
      Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) has resistance to
      necrotic damage, and its hit point maximum can't be reduced. In addition,
      a nonhostile, living creature regains 1 hit point when it starts its turn
      in the aura with 0 hit points.
