    value: You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a
      point you choose within range. Each creature in that area must make a
      Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and
      plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A
      creature takes {@damage 12d8} necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
      much damage on a successful one.

    value: Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and
