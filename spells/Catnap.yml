      value: You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your
        choice that you can see within range fall {@condition unconscious} for
        the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes
        damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target
        remains {@condition unconscious} for the full duration, that target
        gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this
        spell again until it finishes a long rest.
