    value: A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide,
      60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 6d8} radiant
      damage and is {@condition blinded} until your next turn. On a successful
      save, it takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded} by this
      spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until
      the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It
      sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30
      feet. This light is sunlight.
