      value: You unleash a shimmering lance of psychic power from your forehead at a
        creature that you can see within range. Alternatively, you can utter a
        creature's name. If the named target is within range, it becomes the
        spell's target even if you can't see it. If the named target isn't
        within range, the lance dissipates without effect.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the
        target takes {@damage 7d6} psychic damage and is {@condition
        incapacitated} until the start of your next turn. On a successful save,
        the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition
        incapacitated}.
