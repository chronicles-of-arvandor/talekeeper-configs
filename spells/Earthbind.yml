      value: Choose one creature you can see within range. Yellow strips of magical
        energy loop around the creature. The target must succeed on a Strength
        saving throw, or its flying speed (if any) is reduced to 0 feet for the
        spell's duration. An airborne creature affected by this spell safely
        descends at 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground or the spell
        ends.
