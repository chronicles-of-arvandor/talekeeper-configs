      value: You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts
        for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited
        by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information
        about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can
        perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to
        persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM's
        discretion.
