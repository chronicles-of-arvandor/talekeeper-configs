    value: Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical objects
      within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as
      two objects, Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets count as
      eight objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target
      animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or
      until reduced to 0 hit points.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with
      this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control
      multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time,
      issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature
      will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a
      general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you
      issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile
      creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until
      its task is complete.

    value: An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength,
      and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its
      Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30
      feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for
      locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the
      object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such as a
      chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of
      30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops
      to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form, and any remaining
      damage carries over to its original object form.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack
      against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an
      attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM might
      rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on
      its form.
