    value: You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The
      target regains {@dice 4d8 + 15} hit points. For the duration of the spell,
      the target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit
      points each minute).
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The target's severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if
      any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold
      it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the
      stump.
