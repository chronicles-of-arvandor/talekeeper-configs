    value: You create a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see
      within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and
      10 feet thick, and it vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line of
      sight but not movement. A creature is {@condition blinded} while in the
      wall's space and must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves
      there.
