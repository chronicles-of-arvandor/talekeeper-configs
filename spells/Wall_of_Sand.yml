      value: You create a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see
        within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high,
        and 10 feet thick, and it vanishes when the spell ends. It blocks line
        of sight but not movement. A creature is {@condition blinded} while in
        the wall's space and must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it
        moves there.
