      value: You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a
        gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in
        this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has
        resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a
        creature can take in this form are the {@action Dash} action or to
        revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a
        creature is {@condition incapacitated} and can't move. Until the spell
        ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the
        1-minute transformation.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the
        creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which
        it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the
        remaining distance.
