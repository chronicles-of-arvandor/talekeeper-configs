    value: You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a
      gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this
      cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance
      to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in
      this form are the {@action Dash} action or to revert to its normal form.
      Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is {@condition
      incapacitated} and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert
      to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the
      creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it
      does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the
      remaining distance.
