      value: The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others
        to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within
        your reach. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 3d6} necrotic damage,
        and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage
        dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of
        your turns as an action.
