      value: You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition—{@item arrow|phb|arrows}
        or {@item crossbow bolt|phb|crossbow bolts}—in the ground within range
        and lay magic upon them to protect an area. Until the spell ends,
        whenever a creature other than you comes within 30 feet of the
        ammunition for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, one
        piece of ammunition flies up to strike it. The creature must succeed on
        a Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 1d6} piercing damage. The
        piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no ammunition
        remains.
