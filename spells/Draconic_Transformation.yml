        entries:
          - You have {@sense blindsight} with a range of 30 feet. Within that
            range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total
            cover, even if you're {@condition blinded} or in darkness. Moreover,
            you can see an {@condition invisible} creature, unless the creature
            successfully hides from you.

        name: Breath Weapon
        entries:
          - When you cast this spell, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns
            for the duration, you can exhale shimmering energy in a 60-foot
            cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw,
            taking {@damage 6d8} force damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one.

        name: Wings
