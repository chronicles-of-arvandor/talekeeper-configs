    value: You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a
      Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions
      are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is {@condition charmed}
      by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything
      harmful to it. The {@condition charmed} creature regards you as a friendly
      acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was {@condition
      charmed} by you.
