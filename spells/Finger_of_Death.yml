    value: You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see
      within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution
      saving throw. It takes {@damage 7d8 + 30} necrotic damage on a failed
      save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a
      {@creature zombie} that is permanently under your command, following your
      verbal orders to the best of its ability.
