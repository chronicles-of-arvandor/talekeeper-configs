      value: You brandish the weapon used in the spell's casting and make a melee
        attack with it against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the
        target suffers the weapon attack's normal effects and then becomes
        sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. If the
        target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes
        {@damage 1d8} thunder damage, and the spell ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell's damage increases when you reach certain levels. At 5th
        level, the melee attack deals an extra {@damage 1d8} thunder damage to
        the target on a hit, and the damage the target takes for moving
        increases to {@damage 2d8}. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th
        level ({@damage 2d8} and {@damage 3d8}) and again at 17th level
        ({@damage 3d8} and {@damage 4d8}).
