    value: You touch a quiver containing arrows or bolts. When a target is hit by a
      ranged weapon attack using a piece of ammunition drawn from the quiver,
      the target takes an extra {@damage 1d6} fire damage. The spell's magic
      ends on a piece of ammunition when it hits or misses, and the spell ends
      when twelve pieces of ammunition have been drawn from the quiver.
