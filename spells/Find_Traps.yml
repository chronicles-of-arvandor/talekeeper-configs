    value: You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of
      sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would
      inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable,
      which was specifically intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell
      would sense an area affected by the {@spell alarm} spell, a {@spell glyph
      of warding}, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural
      weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the
      location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger
      posed by a trap you sense.
