      value: You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is
        protected from decay and can't become undead.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target
        from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't
        count against the time limit of spells such as {@spell raise dead}.
