    value: You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is
      indistinguishable from death.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: For the spell's duration, or until you use an action to touch the target
      and dismiss the spell, the target appears dead to all outward inspection
      and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target is
      {@condition blinded} and {@condition incapacitated}, and its speed drops
      to 0. The target has resistance to all damage except psychic damage. If
      the target is diseased or {@condition poisoned} when you cast the spell,
      or becomes diseased or {@condition poisoned} while under the spell's
      effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends.
