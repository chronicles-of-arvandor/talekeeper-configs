      value: You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball
        of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere.
        Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
        failed save, a creature takes {@damage 10d4} acid damage and another
        {@damage 5d4} acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful
        save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end
        of its next turn.
