    value: A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature
      in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
      creature takes {@damage 3d8} cold damage and is hindered by ice formations
      for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an
      action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed
      reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage
      and isn't hindered by ice.
