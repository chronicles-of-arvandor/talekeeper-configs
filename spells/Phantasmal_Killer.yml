      value: You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and
        create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to
        that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
        save, the target becomes {@condition frightened} for the duration. At
        the end of each of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target
        must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take {@damage 4d10} psychic
        damage. On a successful save, the spell ends.
