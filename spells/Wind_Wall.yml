    value: A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within
      range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot
      thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes
      one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration.

    value: When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength
      saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 3d8} bludgeoning damage on a
      failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or
      smaller flying creatures or objects can't pass through the wall. Loose,
      lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and
      other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are
      deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or
      siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in
      gaseous form can't pass through it.
