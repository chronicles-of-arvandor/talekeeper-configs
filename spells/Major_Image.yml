  entries:

      value: You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
        phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a
        spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems
        completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate
        to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause
        damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature,
        or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a {@creature
        troglodyte||troglodyte's} stench).
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action
        to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image
        changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements
        appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a
        creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
        walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds
        at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because
        things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine
        the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
        Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC.
        If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
        through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the
        creature.
