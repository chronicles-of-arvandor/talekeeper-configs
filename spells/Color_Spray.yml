      value: A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll
        {@dice 6d10}; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell
        can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are
        affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring
        {@condition unconscious} creatures and creatures that can't see).
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each
        creature affected by this spell is {@condition blinded} until the end of
        your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total
        before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A
        creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total
        for that creature to be affected.
