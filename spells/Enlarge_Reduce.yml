    value: You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger
      or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is
      neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying
      changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to
      normal size at once.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Enlarge
    entries:
      - The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is
        multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category—from
        Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target
        to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible
        size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has
        advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's
        weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are
        enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal {@damage 1d4} extra
        damage.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Reduce
    entries:
      - The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced
        to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one
        category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the
        target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving
        throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While
        these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal {@damage
        1d4} less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
