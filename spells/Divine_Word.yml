    value: "You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at
      the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within
      range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw.
      On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit
      points:"

    items:
      - "50 hit points or fewer: {@condition deafened} for 1 minute"
      - "40 hit points or fewer: {@condition deafened} and {@condition blinded}
        for 10 minutes"
      - "30 hit points or fewer: {@condition blinded}, {@condition deafened},
        and {@condition stunned} for 1 hour"
      - "20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly"
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Regardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey,
      or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of origin (if
      it isn't there already) and can't return to your current plane for 24
      hours by any means short of a {@spell wish} spell.
