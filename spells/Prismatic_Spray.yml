    value: Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a
      different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in a
      60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a
      {@dice d8} to determine which color ray affects it.

    name: 6-Indigo
    entries:
      - On a failed save, the target is {@condition restrained}. It must then
        make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it
        successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save
        three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the
        {@condition petrified} condition. The successes and failures don't need
        to be consecutive, keep track of both until the target collects three of
        a kind.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: 7-Violet
    entries:
      - On a failed save, the target is {@condition blinded}. It must then make
        a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save
        ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported
        to another plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer
        {@condition blinded}. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that
        isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually
        cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
