      value: This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in
        diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an
        unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk
        remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
        is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the
        ground.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more
        than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains
        within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down
        stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of
        10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep
        pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't
        move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.
