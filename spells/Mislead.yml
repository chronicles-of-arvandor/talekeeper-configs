      value: You become {@condition invisible} at the same time that an illusory
        double of you appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the
        duration, but the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your
        speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were
        located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can
        switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you
        are using its senses, you are {@condition blinded} and {@condition
        deafened} in regard to your own surroundings.
