    value: A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and
      above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you
      leave its area.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with
      you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than
      nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this
      spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are
      barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't
      extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the
      space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or
      dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but it
      is transparent from the inside.
