      value: A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and
        above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you
        leave its area.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with
        you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than
        nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this
        spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are
        barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't
        extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the
        space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit or
        dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose, but
        it is transparent from the inside.
