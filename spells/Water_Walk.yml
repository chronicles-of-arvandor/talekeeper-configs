    value: This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as
      water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid
      ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the
      heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this
      ability for the duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the
      target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.
