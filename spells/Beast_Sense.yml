    value: You touch a willing beast. For the duration of the spell, you can use
      your action to see through the beast's eyes and hear what it hears, and
      continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal
      senses. While perceiving through the beast's senses, you gain the benefits
      of any special senses possessed by that creature, though you are
      {@condition blinded} and {@condition deafened} to your own surroundings.
