    value: Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving
      throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other. Either
      creature can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds, the spell
      has no effect. If both saves fail, the creatures are magically linked for
      the duration, regardless of the distance between them. When damage is
      dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other one. If hit
      points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit points are
      restored to the other one. If either of the tethered creatures is reduced
      to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends on one
      creature, it ends on both.
