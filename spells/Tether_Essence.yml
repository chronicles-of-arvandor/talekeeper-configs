      value: Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving
        throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other.
        Either creature can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds,
        the spell has no effect. If both saves fail, the creatures are magically
        linked for the duration, regardless of the distance between them. When
        damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other
        one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit
        points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered
        creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the
        spell ends on one creature, it ends on both.
