    value: You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see
      within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as
      an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.

    value: The hound is {@condition invisible} to all creatures except you and can't
      be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it
      without first speaking the password that you specify when you cast this
      spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees {@condition
      invisible} creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores
      illusions.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one
      creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack
      bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency
      bonus. On a hit, it deals {@damage 4d8} piercing damage.
