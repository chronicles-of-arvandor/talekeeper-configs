    value: You and up to eight willing creatures within range fall {@condition
      unconscious} for the spell's duration and experience visions of another
      world on the Material Plane, such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If
      the spell reaches its full duration, the visions conclude with each of you
      encountering and pulling back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then
      ends with you mentally and physically transported to the world that was in
      the visions.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: To cast this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the
      world you wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world's existence,
      even if you don't know the world's name. Your destination in the other
      world is a safe location within 1 mile of where the magic item was
      created. Alternatively, you can cast the spell if one of the affected
      creatures was born on the other world, which causes your destination to be
      a safe location within 1 mile of where that creature was born.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The spell ends early on a creature if that creature takes any damage, and
      the creature isn't transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for
      you and all the other creatures, with none of you being transported.
