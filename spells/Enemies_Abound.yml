      value: You reach into the mind of one creature you can see and force it to make
        an Intelligence saving throw. A creature automatically succeeds if it is
        immune to being {@condition frightened}. On a failed save, the target
        loses the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all
        creatures it can see as enemies until the spell ends. Each time the
        target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect
        on itself on a success.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as a target, it
        must choose the target at random from among the creatures it can see
        within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it's using. If an
        enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the
        creature must make that attack if it is able to.
