    value: Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square
      starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn
      the ground in the area into {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength
      saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the entangling plants until
      the spell ends. A creature {@condition restrained} by the plants can use
      its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
      success, it frees itself.
