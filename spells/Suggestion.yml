  entries:
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
        magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear
        and understand you. Creatures that can't be {@condition charmed} are
        immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as
        to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to
        stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some
        other obviously harmful act ends the spell.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues
        the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The
        suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the
        suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends
        when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
        during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give
        her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met
        before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.
