      value: "Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected
        against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals,
        fey, fiends, and undead."
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have
        disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't
        be {@condition charmed}, {@condition frightened}, or possessed by them.
        If the target is already {@condition charmed}, {@condition frightened},
        or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new
        saving throw against the relevant effect.
