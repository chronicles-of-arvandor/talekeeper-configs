      value: The wood of a {@item club|phb} or {@item quarterstaff|phb} you are
        holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use
        your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage
        rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die
        becomes a {@dice d8}. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't
        already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the
        weapon.
