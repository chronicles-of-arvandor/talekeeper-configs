    value: You create a blade-shaped planar rift about 3 feet long in an unoccupied
      space you can see within range. The blade lasts for the duration. When you
      cast this spell, you can make up to two melee spell attacks with the
      blade, each one against a creature, loose object, or structure within 5
      feet of the blade. On a hit, the target takes {@damage 4d12} force damage.
      This attack scores a critical hit if the number on the {@dice d20} is 18
      or higher. On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra {@damage 8d12}
      force damage (for a total of {@damage 12d12} force damage).
