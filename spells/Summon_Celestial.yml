    value: You call forth a celestial spirit. It manifests in an angelic form in an
      unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses
      the {@creature Celestial Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell,
      choose Avenger or Defender. Your choice determines the creature's attack
      in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points
      or when the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the
      creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
      after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If
      you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its move
      to avoid danger.
