      value: You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
        that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the {@creature
        Aberrant Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose
        Beholderkin, Slaad, or Star Spawn. The creature resembles an aberration
        of that kind, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The
        creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell
        ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the
        creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
        after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you).
        If you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its
        move to avoid danger.

          block.
