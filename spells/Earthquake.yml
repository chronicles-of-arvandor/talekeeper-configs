    value: You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can
      see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the
      ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes
      creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The ground in the area becomes {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Each
      creature on the ground that is {@status concentration||concentrating} must
      make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's
      {@status concentration} is broken.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend {@status
      concentration||concentrating} on it, each creature on the ground in the
      area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
      knocked {@condition prone}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the
      area, as determined by the DM.

    name: Fissures
    entries:
      - Fissures open throughout the spell's area at the start of your next turn
        after you cast the spell. A total of {@dice 1d6} such fissures open in
        locations chosen by the DM. Each is {@dice 1d10 Ã— 10} feet deep, 10 feet
        wide, and extends from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite
        side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed
        on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully
        saves moves with the fissure's edge as it opens.
      - A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically
        collapse (see below).
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Structures
    entries:
      - The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with
        the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each
        of your turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit
        points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A
        creature within half the distance of a structure's height must make a
        Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes {@damage
        5d6} bludgeoning damage, is knocked {@condition prone}, and is buried in
        the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check as an
        action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on
        the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half
        as much damage and doesn't fall {@condition prone} or become buried.
