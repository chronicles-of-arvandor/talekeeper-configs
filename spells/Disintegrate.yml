      value: A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you
        can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a
        creation of magical force, such as the wall created by {@spell wall of
        force}.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
        a failed save, the target takes {@damage 10d6 + 40} force damage. The
        target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it with 0 hit points.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying,
        except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
        creature can be restored to life only by means of a {@spell true
        resurrection} or a {@spell wish} spell.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical
        object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger
        object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube
        portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.
