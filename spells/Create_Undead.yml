      value: You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of
        Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a {@creature
        ghoul} under your control. (The DM has game statistics for these
        creatures.)
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any
        creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet
        of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of
        them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide
        what action the creature will take and where it will move during its
        next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a
        particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature
        only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the
        creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops
        obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the
        creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
        before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts
        your control over up to three creatures you have animated with this
        spell, rather than animating new ones.
