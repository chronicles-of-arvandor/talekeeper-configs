    value: Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the
      direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within 1,000
      feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its
      movement.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have
      seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell
      can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind
      of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin
      sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.
