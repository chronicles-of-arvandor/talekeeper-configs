  entries:
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force
        centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell's duration,
        the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are {@quickref difficult
        terrain||3}, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are
        destroyed if they aren't being worn or carried.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the
        spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled
        toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to
        the center as possible.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must
        succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the
        sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as
        possible. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn
        or starts its turn there takes {@damage 5d10} force damage and is
        {@condition restrained} until it is no longer in the sphere. If the
        sphere is in the air, the {@condition restrained} creature hovers inside
        the sphere. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check
        against your spell save DC, ending this {@condition restrained}
        condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach.
        A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along
        with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.
