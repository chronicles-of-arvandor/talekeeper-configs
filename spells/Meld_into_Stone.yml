    value: You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain
      your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the stone
      for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point
      you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise
      detectable by nonmagical senses.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: While merged with the stone, you can't see what occurs outside it, and
      any Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks you make to hear sounds outside it
      are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of time and
      can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You can use your
      movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which ends the spell.
      You otherwise can't move.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Minor physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial
      destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit
      within it) expels you and deals {@damage 6d6} bludgeoning damage to you.
      The stone's complete destruction (or transmutation into a different
      substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled,
      you fall {@condition prone} in an unoccupied space closest to where you
      first entered.
