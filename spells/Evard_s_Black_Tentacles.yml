    value: Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can
      see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the
      area into {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or
      starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving
      throw or take {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning damage and be {@condition
      restrained} by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts
      its turn in the area and is already {@condition restrained} by the
      tentacles takes {@damage 3d6} bludgeoning damage.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature {@condition restrained} by the tentacles can use its action to
      make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save
      DC. On a success, it frees itself.
