    value: "You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent,
      strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing
      in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form that you
      choose: a {@creature warhorse}, a {@creature pony}, a {@creature camel},
      an {@creature elk}, or a {@creature mastiff}. (Your DM might allow other
      animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the
      chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead
      of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5
      or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to
      understand one language of your choice that you speak."
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an
      instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit.
      While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets
      only you also target your steed.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no
      physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action,
      causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons
      the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each
      other telepathically.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can't have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an
      action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it to
      disappear.
