      value: This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic
        connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the
        target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving
        throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes
        damage, you take the same amount of damage.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target
        become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast
        again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the
        spell as an action.
