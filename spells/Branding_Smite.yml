    value: The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell
      ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack
      deals an extra {@damage 2d6} radiant damage to the target, which becomes
      visible if it's {@condition invisible}, and the target sheds dim light in
      a 5-foot radius and can't become {@condition invisible} until the spell
      ends.
