      value: You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your
        choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The
        corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if
        the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The
        corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew.
        Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is
        under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it
        or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the
        creature's soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse
        can't learn new information, doesn't comprehend anything that has
        happened since it died, and can't speculate about future events.
