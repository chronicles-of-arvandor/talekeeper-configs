    value: For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at
      one creature of your choice that isn't hostile toward you. When the spell
      ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and
      becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you.
      Another creature might seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's
      discretion), depending on the nature of your interaction with it.
