    value: You choose a point within range and cause psychic energy to explode
      there. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point
      must make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature with an Intelligence
      score of 2 or lower can't be affected by this spell. A target takes
      {@damage 8d6} psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: After a failed save, a target has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During
      that time, it rolls a {@dice d6} and subtracts the number rolled from all
      its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving
      throws to maintain {@status concentration}. The target can make an
      Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
      effect on itself on a success.
