    value: By gathering threads of shadow material from the Shadowfell, you create a
      Huge shadowy dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range.
      The illusion lasts for the spell's duration and occupies its space, as if
      it were a creature.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of it
      for 1 minute. If a {@condition frightened} creature ends its turn in a
      location where it doesn't have line of sight to the illusion, it can
      repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: "As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet.
      At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of
      energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the
      dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or
      poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw,
      taking {@damage 7d6} damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or
      half as much damage on a successful one."
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it,
      but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and
      it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action
      to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding
      on an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save
      DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can
      see through it and has advantage on saving throws against its breath.
