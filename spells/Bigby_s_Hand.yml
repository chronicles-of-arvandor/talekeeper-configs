    value: You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied
      space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell's
      duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your
      own hand.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit
      point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a
      Strength of 26 ({@d20 8}) and a Dexterity of 10 ({@d20 0}). The hand
      doesn't fill its space.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns,
      you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following
      effects with it.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Clenched Fist
    entries:
      - The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a
        melee spell attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit,
        the target takes {@damage 4d8} force damage.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Forceful Hand
    entries:
      - The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction
        you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength contested by the
        Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check of the target. If the target is
        Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the
        hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five
        times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target
        to remain within 5 feet of it.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Grasping Hand
    entries:
      - The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of
        it. You use the hand's Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the
        target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the
        hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the
        hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal
        to {@damage 2d6} + your spellcasting ability modifier.
  - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
    name: Interposing Hand
    entries:
      - The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until
        you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between
        you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target.
        The target can't move through the hand's space if its Strength score is
        less than or equal to the hand's Strength score. If its Strength score
        is higher than the hand's Strength score, the target can move toward you
        through the hand's space, but that space is {@quickref difficult
        terrain||3} for the target.

        4d8|5-9|2d8} and the damage from the grasping hand increases by
