      value: Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or
        violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is
        cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For
        the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot
        radius.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if
        the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't
        benefit from being {@condition invisible}.
