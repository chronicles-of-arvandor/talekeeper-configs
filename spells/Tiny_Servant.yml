      value: You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that isn't attached to another
        object or a surface and isn't being carried by another creature. The
        target animates and sprouts little arms and legs, becoming a creature
        under your control until the spell ends or the creature drops to 0 hit
        points. See the {@creature tiny servant|xge|stat block} for its
        statistics.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within
        120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you
        can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same
        command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and
        where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple,
        general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some
        books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than
        defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the
        servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original form,
        and any remaining damage carries over to that form.
