    value: By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a
      Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a
      bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a recipient
      who matches a general description, such as "a man or woman dressed in the
      uniform of the town guard" or "a red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat."
      You also speak a message of up to twenty-five words. The target beast
      travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified location,
      covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles
      for other animals.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature that
      you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger speaks
      only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the messenger
      doesn't reach its destination before the spell ends, the message is lost,
      and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this spell.
