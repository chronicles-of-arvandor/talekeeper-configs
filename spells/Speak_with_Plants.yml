    value: You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and
      animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your
      simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell's area
      within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed,
      weather, and other circumstances.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can also turn {@quickref difficult terrain||3} caused by plant growth
      (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for
      the duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present
      into {@quickref difficult terrain||3} that lasts for the duration, causing
      vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM's
      discretion. The spell doesn't enable plants to uproot themselves and move
      about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you
      shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: This spell can cause the plants created by the {@spell entangle} spell to
      release a {@condition restrained} creature.
