    value: You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and
      smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road
      can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult
      or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a
      precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and
      smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the
      area aren't changed in appearance.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures
      entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the
      difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the
      illusion can attempt an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check
      against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the
      illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the
      terrain.
