    value: A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within
      range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered
      on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the
      whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind
      sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and
      that aren't worn or carried by anyone.

    value: A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn
      that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space,
      including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes {@damage
      10d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the
      save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become {@condition
      restrained} in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts
      its turn {@condition restrained} by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled
      5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A {@condition
      restrained} creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell
      ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A {@condition restrained} creature can use an action to make a Strength
      or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature
      is no longer {@condition restrained} by the whirlwind and is hurled {@dice
      3d6 Ã— 10} feet away from it in a random direction.
