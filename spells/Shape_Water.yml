    items:
      - You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as
        you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn't have
        enough force to cause damage.
      - You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your
        direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.
      - You change the water's color or opacity. The water must be changed in
        the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.
      - You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The
        water unfreezes in 1 hour.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of
      its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such
      an effect as an action.
