      value: You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone
        no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that
        suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a
        weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long
        as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door
        or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to
        two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
