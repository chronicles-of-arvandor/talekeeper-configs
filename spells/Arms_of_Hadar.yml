      value: You invoke the power of Hadar, the Dark Hunger. Tendrils of dark energy
        erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each
        creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed
        save, a target takes {@damage 2d6} necrotic damage and can't take
        reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes
        half damage, but suffers no other effect.
