    items:
      - If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate
        it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This
        movement doesn't involve enough force to cause damage.
      - You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone,
        spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes
        last for 1 hour.
      - If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become
        {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Alternatively, you can cause the
        ground to become normal terrain if it is already {@quickref difficult
        terrain||3}. This change lasts for 1 hour.

    value: If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of
