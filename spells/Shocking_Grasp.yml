    value: Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try
      to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage
      on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit,
      the target takes {@damage 1d8} lightning damage, and it can't take
      reactions until the start of its next turn.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The spell's damage increases by {@dice 1d8} when you reach 5th level
      ({@damage 2d8}), 11th level ({@damage 3d8}), and 17th level ({@damage
      4d8}).
