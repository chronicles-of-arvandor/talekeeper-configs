    value: You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
      magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see
      within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be
      {@condition charmed} are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be
      worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable.
      Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate
      itself, or do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the
      effect of the spell.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues
      the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The
      suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the
      suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when
      the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
      during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of
      soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the
      condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this
      spell, the spell ends for that creature.
