    value: You shatter the barriers between realities and timelines, thrusting a
      creature into turmoil and madness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom
      saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the spell ends. The
      affected target must also roll a {@dice d10} at the start of each of its
      turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target, as shown
      on the Reality Break Effects table.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the
      Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.
