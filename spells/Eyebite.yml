      value: For the spell's duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread
        power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can
        see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the
        following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns
        until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature
        but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw
        against this casting of eyebite.

      entries:
        - The target falls {@condition unconscious}. It wakes up if it takes any
          damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper
          awake.
    - ==: EntriesSpellEntry
      name: Panicked
      entries:
        - The target is {@condition frightened} of you. On each of its turns,
          the {@condition frightened} creature must take the {@action Dash}
          action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available
          route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place
          at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this
          effect ends.

      name: Sickened
      entries:
        - The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the
          end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If
          it succeeds, the effect ends.
