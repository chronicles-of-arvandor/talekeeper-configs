    value: Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell
      ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has
      advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on
      each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the {@action
      Attack} (one weapon attack only), {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage},
      {@action Hide}, or {@action Use an Object} action.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after
      its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
