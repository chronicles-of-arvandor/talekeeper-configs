    value: "You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a
      nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood,
      or something similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral
      objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no
      larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a form and material
      that you have seen before."

    value: The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed
      of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.
