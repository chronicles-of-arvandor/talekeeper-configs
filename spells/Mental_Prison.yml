      value: You attempt to bind a creature within an illusory cell that only it
        perceives. One creature you can see within range must make an
        Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds automatically if it is
        immune to being {@condition charmed}. On a successful save, the target
        takes {@damage 5d10} psychic damage, and the spell ends. On a failed
        save, the target takes {@damage 5d10} psychic damage, and you make the
        area immediately around the target's space appear dangerous to it in
        some way. You might cause the target to perceive itself as being
        surrounded by fire, floating razors, or hideous maws filled with
        dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes, the target can't see
        or hear anything beyond it and is {@condition restrained} for the
        spell's duration. If the target is moved out of the illusion, makes a
        melee attack through it, or reaches any part of its body through it, the
        target takes {@damage 10d10} psychic damage, and the spell ends.
