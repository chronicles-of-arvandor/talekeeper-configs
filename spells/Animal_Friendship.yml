      value: This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a
        beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the
        beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the
        beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed}
        by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms
        the target, the spell ends.
