    value: This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a
      beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the
      beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast
      must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by you
      for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the
      target, the spell ends.
