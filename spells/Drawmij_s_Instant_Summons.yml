      value: You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension is
        6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and
        invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the
        material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a
        different sapphire.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item's name
        and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand
        regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the
        sapphire doesn't transport the item to you, but instead you learn who
        the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that creature is
        located at that moment.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: "{@spell Dispel magic} or a similar effect successfully applied to the
        sapphire ends this spell's effect."
