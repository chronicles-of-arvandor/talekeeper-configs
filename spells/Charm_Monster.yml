      value: You attempt to charm a creature you can see within range. It must make a
        Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your
        companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is
        {@condition charmed} by you until the spell ends or until you or your
        companions do anything harmful to it. The {@condition charmed} creature
        is friendly to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was
        {@condition charmed} by you.
