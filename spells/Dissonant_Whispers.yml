      value: You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice
        within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must
        make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes {@damage 3d6}
        psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to
        move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn't move
        into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a
        successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have
        to move away. A {@condition deafened} creature automatically succeeds on
        the save.
