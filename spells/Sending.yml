    value: You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with
      which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind,
      recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
      manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores
      of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of
      existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a
      {@chance 5|||Message lost!|Message arrives} chance that the message
      doesn't arrive.
