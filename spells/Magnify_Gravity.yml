      value: The gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see
        within range increases for a moment. Each creature in the sphere on the
        turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
        failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d8} force damage, and its speed
        is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a
        creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its
        speed.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Until the start of your next turn, any object that isn't being worn or
        carried in the sphere requires a successful Strength check against your
        spell save DC to pick up or move.
