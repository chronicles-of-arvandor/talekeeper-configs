      value: You attempt to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can
        see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
        creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand. For the
        duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other
        than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to
        move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds
        on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement
        for that turn.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that
        targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly
        to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end
        your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
