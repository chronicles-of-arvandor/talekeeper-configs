    value: You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage
      for the spell's duration.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you take damage of one of those types, you can use your reaction to
      gain immunity to that type of damage, including against the triggering
      damage. If you do so, the resistances end, and you have the immunity until
      the end of your next turn, at which time the spell ends.
