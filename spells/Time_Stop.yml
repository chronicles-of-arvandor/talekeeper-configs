      value: You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time
        passes for other creatures, while you take {@dice 1d4 + 1} turns in a
        row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any
        effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other
        than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you.
        In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet
        from the location where you cast it.
