    value: This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll {@dice 5d8}; the
      total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures
      within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in
      ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring {@condition
      unconscious} creatures).
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each
      creature affected by this spell falls {@condition unconscious} until the
      spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake
      or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature's hit points from the
      total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A
      creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total
      for that creature to be affected.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Undead and creatures immune to being {@condition charmed} aren't affected
      by this spell.
