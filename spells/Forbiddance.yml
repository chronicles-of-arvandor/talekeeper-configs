      value: You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000
        square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For
        the duration, creatures can't teleport into the area or use portals,
        such as those created by the {@spell gate} spell, to enter the area. The
        spell proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents
        creatures from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal
        Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the {@spell plane shift} spell.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: "In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when
        you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials,
        elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the
        spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the
        creature takes {@damage 5d10} radiant or necrotic damage (your choice
        when you cast this spell)."
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that
        speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the
        spell.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another forbiddance
        spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for 30 days in the same
        location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material
        components are consumed on the last casting.
