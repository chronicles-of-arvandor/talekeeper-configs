    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to
        a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane
        of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a
        destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination
        that isn't specific (such as "a green dragon's lair"), the spell fails.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as
        the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies.
        While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice
        of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the
        shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to
        the destination.
