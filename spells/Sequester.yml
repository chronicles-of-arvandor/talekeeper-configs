      value: By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden
        away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and
        touch the target, it becomes {@condition invisible} and can't be
        targeted by {@filter divination spells|spells|school=D} or perceived
        through scrying sensors created by divination spells.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended
        animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be
        anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of
        the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the {@creature
        tarrasque} awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any
        damage.
