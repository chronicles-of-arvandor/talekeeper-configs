    value: You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.
      You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don't
      have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions, which
      are determined by the DM based on the climate and season. You can change
      precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes {@dice 1d4 Ã— 10} minutes
      for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change the
      conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to
      normal.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the
      following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing
      the wind, you can change its direction.
