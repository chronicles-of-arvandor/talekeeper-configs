    value: Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to pierce up to five Small
      or Medium corpses you can see within range. Each corpse immediately stands
      up and becomes undead. You decide whether it is a {@creature zombie} or a
      {@creature skeleton} (the statistics for {@creature zombie||zombies} and
      {@creature skeleton||skeletons} are in the Monster Manual), and it gains a
      bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your spellcasting ability
      modifier.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: You can use a bonus action to mentally command the creatures you make
      with this spell, issuing the same command to all of them. To receive the
      command, a creature must be within 60 feet of you. You decide what action
      the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turn,
      or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or
      passageway against your foes. If you issue no commands, the creatures do
      nothing except defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an
      order, the creatures continue to follow it until their task is complete.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The creatures are under your control until the spell ends, after which
      they become inanimate once more.
