      value: A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your
        choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends
        its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw.
        The creature takes {@damage 2d6} fire damage on a failed save, or half
        as much damage on a successful one.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the
        sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against
        the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet
        tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites
        flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light
        in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
