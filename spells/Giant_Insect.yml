    value: You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one
      scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the
      duration. A centipede becomes a {@creature giant centipede}, a spider
      becomes a {@creature giant spider}, a wasp becomes a {@creature giant
      wasp}, and a scorpion becomes a {@creature giant scorpion}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your
      turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and
      resolves their actions and movement.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to
      0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you
      transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a
      {@creature giant wasp}.
