    value: "You call forth the spirit of a construct. It manifests in an unoccupied
      space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the
      {@creature Construct Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell,
      choose a material: Clay, Metal, or Stone. The creature resembles a golem
      or a modron (your choice) made of the chosen material, which determines
      certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to
      0 hit points or when the spell ends."
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the
      creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
      after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If
      you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its move
      to avoid danger.
