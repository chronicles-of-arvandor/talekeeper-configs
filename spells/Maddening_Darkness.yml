    value: Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a
      60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends. The darkness spreads around
      corners. A creature with {@sense darkvision} can't see through this
      darkness. Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th
      level or lower, can't illuminate the area.

    value: Shrieks, gibbering, and mad laughter can be heard within the sphere.
      Whenever a creature starts its turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom
      saving throw, taking {@damage 8d8} psychic damage on a failed save, or
      half as much damage on a successful one.
