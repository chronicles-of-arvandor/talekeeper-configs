    value: Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a
      casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that
      spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting contingency,
      expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into
      effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You
      describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a
      contingency cast with {@spell water breathing} might stipulate that
      {@spell water breathing} comes into effect when you are engulfed in water
      or a similar liquid.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is
      met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then
      contingency ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally
      target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you
      cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you
      ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not
      on your person.
