    value: You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with
      needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and
      lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10
      feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is
      up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a
      Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 7d8}
      piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For
      every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of
      movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a turn
      or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
      It takes {@damage 7d8} slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one.
