    value: Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the
      direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within
      1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of
      its movement.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest
      creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a {@creature unicorn}), so
      long as you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least
      once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such
      as being under the effects of a {@spell polymorph} spell, this spell
      doesn't locate the creature.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide
      blocks a direct path between you and the creature.
