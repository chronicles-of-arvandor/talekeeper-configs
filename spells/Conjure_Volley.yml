      value: You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a
        nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds
        of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above
        and then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high
        cylinder centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
        creature takes {@damage 8d8} damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the
        ammunition or weapon.

    - DEXTERITY
