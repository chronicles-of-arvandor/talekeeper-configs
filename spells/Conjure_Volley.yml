    value: You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a
      nonmagical weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds
      of duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and
      then disappear. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder
      centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
      takes {@damage 8d8} damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the ammunition or
      weapon.
