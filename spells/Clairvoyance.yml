  entries:
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you
        (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that
        is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a
        grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it
        can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the
        chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your
        action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from
        {@spell see invisibility} or {@sense truesight}) sees a luminous,
        intangible orb about the size of your fist.
