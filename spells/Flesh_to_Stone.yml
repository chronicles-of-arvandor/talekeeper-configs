    value: You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into
      stone. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is {@condition restrained}
      as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't
      affected.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature {@condition restrained} by this spell must make another
      Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it
      successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it
      fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the
      {@condition petrified} condition for the duration. The successes and
      failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target
      collects three of a kind.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If the creature is physically broken while {@condition petrified}, it
      suffers from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you maintain your {@status concentration} on this spell for the entire
      possible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is
      removed.
