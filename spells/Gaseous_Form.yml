      value: You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it's
        wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell
        ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature
        isn't affected.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a flying
        speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another
        creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has
        advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The
        target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere
        cracks, though it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The
        target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when {@condition
        stunned} or otherwise {@condition incapacitated}.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk or manipulate
        objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped,
        used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can't attack or cast
        spells.
