    value: You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature
      in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the
      target takes {@damage 2d8 + 1d6} damage. Choose one of the {@dice d8}s.
      The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as
      shown below.

    value: If you roll the same number on both {@dice d8}s, the chaotic energy leaps
      from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of
      it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage
      roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
