      value: You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can
        see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and
        reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target
        must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
        {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage and is {@condition restrained} for the
        spell's duration.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the {@condition restrained}
        target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes
        {@damage 2d6} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much
        damage on a successful one.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: To break out, the {@condition restrained} target can use its action to
        make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the
        target escapes and is no longer {@condition restrained} by the hand.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or
        to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases
        a {@condition restrained} target if you do either.
