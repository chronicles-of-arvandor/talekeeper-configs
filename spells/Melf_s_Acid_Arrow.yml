      value: A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts
        in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a
        hit, the target takes {@damage 4d4} acid damage immediately and {@damage
        2d4} acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow
        splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and
        no damage at the end of its next turn.
