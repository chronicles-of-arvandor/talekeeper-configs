      value: The light of dawn shines down on a location you specify within range.
        Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright
        light glimmers there. This light is sunlight.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution
        saving throw, taking {@damage 4d10} radiant damage on a failed save, or
        half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this
        saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it up to 60 feet
        as a bonus action on your turn.
