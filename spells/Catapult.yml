    value: Choose one object weighing 1 to 5 pounds within range that isn't being
      worn or carried. The object flies in a straight line up to 90 feet in a
      direction you choose before falling to the ground, stopping early if it
      impacts against a solid surface. If the object would strike a creature,
      that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
      object strikes the target and stops moving. When the object strikes
      something, the object and what it strikes each take {@damage 3d8}
      bludgeoning damage.
