    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and
        even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape
        remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to
        resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable
        terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice
        like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where
        none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements,
        so it can turn clear ground into {@quickref difficult terrain||3} (or
        vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of
        the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the
        spell's area disappears immediately.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Creatures with {@sense truesight} can see through the illusion to the
        terrain's true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain,
        so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature
        can still physically interact with the illusion.
