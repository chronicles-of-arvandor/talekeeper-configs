      value: You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the
        duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance
        shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any
        creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the
        extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can
        open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed,
        the portal is invisible.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond.
        The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50
        cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and
        decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine
        course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent
        servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of
        these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your
        orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could
        perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly
        harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend,
        fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The
        servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings
        and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed
        from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures or objects left
        inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces
        nearest to the entrance.
