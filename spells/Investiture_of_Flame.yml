    value: "Flames race across your body, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius
      and dim light for an additional 30 feet for the spell's duration. The
      flames don't harm you. Until the spell ends, you gain the following
      benefits:"

    items:
      - You are immune to fire damage and have resistance to cold damage.
      - Any creature that moves within 5 feet of you for the first time on a
        turn or ends its turn there takes {@damage 1d10} fire damage.
      - You can use your action to create a line of fire 15 feet long and 5 feet
        wide extending from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the
        line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes {@damage 4d8}
        fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
        one.
