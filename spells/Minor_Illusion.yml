    value: You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for
      the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or
      cast this spell again.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.
      It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of
      drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
      throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different
      times before the spell ends.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints, or
      a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can't
      create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical
      interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things
      can pass through it.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature
      can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
      ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
      discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the
      creature.
