      value: A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range.
        Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target
        takes {@damage 4d6} radiant damage, and the next attack roll made
        against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage,
        thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.
