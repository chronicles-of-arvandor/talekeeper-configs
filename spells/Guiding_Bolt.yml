    value: A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range.
      Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes
      {@damage 4d6} radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this
      target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the
      mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.
