    value: You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples
      outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 5d6} thunder
      damage, as well as {@damage 5d6} radiant or necrotic damage (your choice),
      and be knocked {@condition prone}. A creature that succeeds on its saving
      throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked {@condition prone}.
