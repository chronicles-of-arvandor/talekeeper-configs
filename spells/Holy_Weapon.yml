      value: You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the
        weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an
        additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an
        extra {@damage 2d8} radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already
        a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the
        weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that
        you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving
        throw. On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 4d8} radiant damage,
        and it is {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a successful save, a
        creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded}. At
        the end of each of its turns, a {@condition blinded} creature can make a
        Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
