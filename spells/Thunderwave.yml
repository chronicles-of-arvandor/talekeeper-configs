      value: A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a
        15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw.
        On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d8} thunder damage and is
        pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes
        half as much damage and isn't pushed.

      value: In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of
        effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's
        effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
