    value: A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a
      15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw.
      On a failed save, a creature takes {@damage 2d8} thunder damage and is
      pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes
      half as much damage and isn't pushed.

    value: In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of
      effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's
      effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.
