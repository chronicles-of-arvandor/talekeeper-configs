    value: This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new
      form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the
      effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit
      points.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0
      hit points or dies. The new form can be {@filter any
      beast|bestiary|type=beast|miscellaneous=!swarm} whose challenge rating is
      equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't
      have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental
      ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It
      retains its alignment and personality.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its
      normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had
      before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit
      points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the
      excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points,
      it isn't knocked unconscious.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of
      its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action
      that requires hands or speech.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate,
      use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
