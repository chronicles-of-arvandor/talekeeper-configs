      value: You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where
        it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal
        for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell.
        During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up or down,
        every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and hear the
        plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and you
        can't see anything more than 60 feet away.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other
        creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane
        can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability
        or magic has given them the ability to do so.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: You ignore all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane,
        allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you
        originated from.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated
        from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a
        solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted
        to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force
        damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal
        Plane or a plane that doesn't border it, such as one of the Outer
        Planes.
