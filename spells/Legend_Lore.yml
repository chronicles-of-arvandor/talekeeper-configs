      value: Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your
        mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named.
        The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even
        secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named
        isn't of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more
        information you already have about the thing, the more precise and
        detailed the information you receive is.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: 'The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative
        language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the
        spell might yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand
        touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.
        Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the
        true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the
        lips."'
