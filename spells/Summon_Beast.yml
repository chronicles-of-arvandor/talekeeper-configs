    value: "You call forth a bestial spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space
      that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the {@creature
      Bestial Spirit|TCE} stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an
      environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature resembles an animal of your
      choice that is native to the chosen environment, which determines certain
      traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit
      points or when the spell ends."
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the
      creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately
      after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If
      you don't issue any, it takes the {@action Dodge} action and uses its move
      to avoid danger.
