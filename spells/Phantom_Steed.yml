    value: A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an
      unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's
      appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the
      equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is
      carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The
      creature uses the statistics for a {@creature riding horse}, except it has
      a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a
      fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the
      rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss
      it or if the steed takes any damage.
