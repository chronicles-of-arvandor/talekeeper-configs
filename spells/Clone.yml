    text: a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of
      the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel
      worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to
      hold the creature being cloned, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled
      cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water

    value: This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard
      against death. This clone forms inside the vessel used in the spell's
      casting and grows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also
      choose to have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It
      remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains
      undisturbed.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its
      soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing to
      return. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same
      personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's
      equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still exist,
      become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the
      creature's soul is elsewhere.
