    value: After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a
      precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target
      must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less.
      The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability
      to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the
      ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it
      gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate
      for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the {@creature awakened
      shrub} or the {@creature awakened tree}.
  - ==: StringSpellEntry
    value: The awakened beast or plant is {@condition charmed} by you for 30 days or
      until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the
      {@condition charmed} condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether
      to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was
      {@condition charmed}.
