      value: You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within
        range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target
        must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened}
        of you until the spell ends. The {@condition frightened} target can
        repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
        effect on itself on a success.
