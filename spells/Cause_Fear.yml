    value: You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within
      range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition frightened} of you
      until the spell ends. The {@condition frightened} target can repeat the
      saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
      on a success.
