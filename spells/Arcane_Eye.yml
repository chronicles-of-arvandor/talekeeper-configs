        for the duration.

      value: You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal
        vision and {@sense darkvision} out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every
        direction.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There
        is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can't
        enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye's
        movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in
        diameter.
