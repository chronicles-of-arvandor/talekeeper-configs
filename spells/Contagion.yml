      value: Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature
        within your reach. On a hit, the target is {@condition poisoned}.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: At the end of each of the {@condition poisoned} target's turns, the
        target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target succeeds on
        three of these saves, it is no longer {@condition poisoned}, and the
        spell ends. If the target fails three of these saves, the target is no
        longer {@condition poisoned}, but choose one of the diseases below. The
        target is subjected to the chosen disease for the spell's duration.
    - ==: StringSpellEntry
      value: Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect that
        removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects apply to
        it.
