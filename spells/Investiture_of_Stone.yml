      items:
        - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from
          nonmagical attacks.
        - You can use your action to create a small earthquake on the ground in
          a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that ground must
          succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked {@condition prone}.
        - You can move across {@quickref difficult terrain||3} made of earth or
          stone without spending extra movement. You can move through solid
          earth or stone as if it was air and without destabilizing it, but you
          can't end your movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the
          nearest unoccupied space, this spell ends, and you are {@condition
          stunned} until the end of your next turn.
