    value: You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within
      range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
      it takes {@damage 14d6} necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a
      successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1.
      If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for
      1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that
      removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to
      normal before that time passes.
