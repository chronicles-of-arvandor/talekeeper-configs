If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute until it takes any damage. 
               A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 3o feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 
               After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throws against your Arcane abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the banishment spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the arcane banishment table.

               When you hit a creature with a melee attack while this Channel Divinity is active, fire leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice that cou can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes fire damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell's damage increases when you reach higher levels.

               At 5th level the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target and the fire damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level  and 17th level. 
               at 6th level when you gain your second use of channel divinity, you can choose to spend two uses of Channel divnity instead of one, changing its damage type from fire to Radiant.
