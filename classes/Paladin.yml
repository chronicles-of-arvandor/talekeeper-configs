              You gain the following two Channel Divinity options: 
               Nature's Wrath: You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke Primeval forces to ensare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity Saving throw (its choice) or be Restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish. 
               OR 
               Turn the Faithless: You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. 
               A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there is nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. 
               If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting or other effect that form is revealed while it is turned.

              Conquering Presence. You can use your Channel Divinity to exude a
              terrifying presence. As an action, you force each creature of your
              choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom
              saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of
              you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving
              throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a

               OR 
               Guided strike. You can use your Channel divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divnity to gain a +10 Bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

          You have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer
          to cast spells as a cleric does. 
           The paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
           You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paldin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level rounded down (minimum of 1 spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
           You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: atleast 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 
           Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.
