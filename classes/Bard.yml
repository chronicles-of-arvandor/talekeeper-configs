            name: Motes of Potential
            description: >-
              Whenever you give a creature a Bardic inspiration die, you can
              utter a note from the song of creation to create a tiny mote of
              potential, which orbits within 5 feet of that creature. The mote
              is intangible and invulnerable, and lasts until the Bardic
              inspiration die is lost. The mote looks like a musical note, a
              star, a flower, or another symbol of art or life that you choose. 
               When the creature uses the bardic inspiration die, the mote provides an additional effect based on whether the die beenfits an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw as detailed below: 
               Ability check. When the creature rolls the Bardic inspiration die to add it to an ability check, the creature can roll the Bardic inspiration die again and choose which roll to use as the mote pops and emits colorful harmelss sparks for a moment. 
               Attack roll. Immediately after the creature rolls the bardic isnpiration die to add it to an attack roll against a target, the mote thunderously shatters. The target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your save DC or take Thunder damage equal to the number rolled on the Bardic inspiration die. 
               Saving throw. Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, the mote vanishes with a sound of soft music, causing the creature to gain temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the bardic inspiration die plus your charisma modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).

            name: Performance of Creation
            description: >-
              As an action, you can channel the magic of the Son of Creation to
              create one nonmagical item of your choice in an unoccupied space
              within 10 feet of you. The item must appear on a surface or a
              liquid that can support it. The Gp value of the item can't be more
              than 20 times your bard level, and the item must be medium or
              smaller. The item glimmers softly and a creature can faintly hear
              music when touching it. The created item disappears after a number
              of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. For examples of items
              you can create, see the equipment chapter of the players
              handbook. 
               Once you create an item with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one item created by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have an item from this feature, the first one immediately vanishes. 
               The size of the item you can create with this feature increases by one size category when you reach 6th level (large) and 14th level (huge)

            description: >-
              As an action, you can target a large or smaller nonmagical item
              you can see within 30 feet of you and animate it. The animate item
              uses the Dancing Item stat block, which uses your proficiency
              bonus (PB). The item is friendly to you and your companions and
              obeys your commands. It lives for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0
              hit points, or until you die. 
               In combat, the item shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the item can take any action of its choice, not just dodge. 
               When you use your Bardic inspiration feature, you can command the item as part of the same bonus action you use for bardic inspiration. 
               Once you animate an item with this feature, you  can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can only have one item animated by this feature at a time; if you use this action and already have a dancing item from this feature the first on immediately becomes inanimate.

               If you speak to a humanoid alone for atleast 1 minute, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into it's mind. At the end of the conversation, the target must succeed on a Wisdom Saving throw against your spell save DC or be frightened of you or another creature of your choice. The target is frightened this way for 1 hour, until it is attacked or damaged, or until it wisnesses its allies being attacked or damaged. If the target succeeds on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.

              You gain the ability to adopt a humanoids persona. When a humanoid
              dies within 30 feet of you, you can magically capture its shadow
              using your reaction. You retain this shadow until you use it or
              finish a long rest. 
               You can use the shadow as an action. When you do so, it vanishes, magically transforming into a disguise that appears on you. You now look like the dead person, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts for 1 hour or until you end it on a bonus action. 
               While you're in the disguise you gain access to all the information that the humanoid would freely share with a casual acquaintance. Such information includes general details on its background and personal life, but doesn't include secrets. The information is enough that you can pass yourself off as the person by drawing on its memories. 
               Another creature can see through this disguise by succeeding on a Wisdom (insight) check contested by your Charisma (deception) check. You gain a +5 bonus to your check. 
               Once you capture a shadow with this feature, you can't capture another one with it until you finish a short or long rest.
