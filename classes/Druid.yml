              invoke the shadowy power of the Gloaming Court to help guard your
              respite. At the start of the rest, you touch a point in space, and
              an invisible 30-foot-radius sphere of magic appears, centered on
              that point. Total cover blocks the sphere. 
               While within the sphere, you and your allies gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom (Perception) checks, and any light from open flames in the sphere (a campfire, torches, or the like) isn't visible outside it. 
               the sphere vanishes at the end of the rest or when you leave the sphere.

               Bear spirit. The bear spirit grants you and your allies might and endurance.

               Archer. A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets 1 creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the attack deals radiant damage equal to 1d8+ your Wisdom modifier. 
               Chalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain hit points equal to 1d8+ your Wisdom modifier.

              You have formed a bond with a wildfire spirit, a primordial being
              of creation and destruction. Your link with this spirit grants you
              access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class
              as shown on the wildfire spells table. 
               Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

            name: Summon Wildfire Spirit
            description: >-
              You can summon the primal spirit bound to your soul. As an action,
              you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon your
              wildfire spirit, rather than assuming a beast form. 
               The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of the spirit (other than you) when it appears must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell DC or take 2d6 fire damage. 
               The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creatures game statistics in the Wildfire Spirit Stat Block, which uses your Proficiency Bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the spirit's apperance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid figure made of gnarled branches covered in flame, while others look like beasts wreathed in fire. 
               In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated the spirit can take any action of its choice not just Dodge. 
               The spirit manifests for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the spirit again, or until you die.

            description: >-
              The bond with your wildfire spirit enhances your destructive and
              restorative spells. Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire
              damage or restores hit points while your wildfire spirit is
              summoned, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus equal to the number
              rolled to one damage or to one healing roll of the spell. 
               In addition, when you cast a spell with a range ohter than self, the spell can originate from you or your widfire spirit.

          language and use it to leave hidden Messages. You and others who know
          this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the

          You know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list, you
          learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels as
          shown in the cantrips known column of the druid table. 
           The druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells at 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
           You prepare the list of Druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of Druid spells equal to your Wisdom Modifier + your Druid level (minimum of 1 spell) the spells must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots. 
           You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of Druid spells requires time spent in prayer and Meditiation. atleast 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

      - name: Wild Shape
        description: >-
          You can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that
          you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain
          expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest. 
           Your druid level determines the Beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. at 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower  that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed. 
           You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down) you then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconcious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. 
           While you are transformed, the following rules apply: 
           Your game Statistics are replaced by the Statistics of the beast, but you retain your Alignment, Personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw Proficiencies in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus isntead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or Lair actions, you can't use them. 
           When you transform, you assume the beast's Hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of Hit points you had before you transformed. However if you revert as a result of Dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and only have 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconcious 
           You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilites of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your Concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking Actions that are part of a spell such as Call Lightning that you've already cast. 
           You retain the benefits of any features from your class, race, or otehr source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses such as darkvision unless your new form also has that sense. 
           You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no Effect until you leave the form.
      - name: Druid Circle
        description: You choose to identify with a circle of druids and pick said circle
          as a sub-class. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again
          at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.
