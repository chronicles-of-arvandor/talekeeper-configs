              You can magically summon a primal beast, which draws strength from
              your bond with nature. The beast is friendly to you and your
              companions and obeys your commands. Choose it's stat block - Beast
              of the Land, Beast of the Sea, or Beast of the Sky - which uses
              your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You also  determine
              the kind of animal the beast is, choosing a kind of appropriate
              stat block. Whatever kind you choose, the beast bears primal
              markings, indicating it's mystical origin. 
               In combat, the beast acts during your turn. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action takes is the dodge action unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. You can also sacrifice one of your attacks when you take the attack action to command the beast to take the attack action. If you are Incapacitated, the beast can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge 
               If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored. 
               When you finish a long rest, you can summon a different primal beast. The new beast appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, and you choose its stat block and apperance. If you already have a beast from this feature, it vanishes when the new beast appears. The beast also vanishes if you die.

          You have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells,
          much as a druid does. The ranger table shows how many spell slots you
          have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one
          of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spells level or higher.
          You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. 
           You start knowing two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. The spells known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 
           Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells.
